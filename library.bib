abstract = {BACKGROUND: The September 2008 melamine outbreak in China has adversely affected perceptions of food safety among consumers. This paper presents a survey of the perception of food safety and willingness to pay for certified traceable (CT) food among the citizens of Jiangsu Province. It presents the critical necessity of establishing a food traceability system (FTS) to address possible similar outbreaks in the future. RESULTS: The results show that 36\% of the respondents are strongly dissatisfied with food safety conditions in the province. Only 37\% of the respondents have heard of FTS. Among the respondents who chose to buy CT food, 32\% were unwilling to shoulder the extra cost. The consumers' overall satisfaction with food safety, awareness of FTS, gender, age, educational level and income are the main determinants of Chinese consumers' willingness to pay for CT food. CONCLUSION: Based on the results, it is proposed that the Chinese government pay attention to the mentality of its citizens when establishing an FTS and take measures to lift consumers' willingness to pay for CT food. Results of this study will provide valuable insights to developing countries.},

@article{Mukherjee2009,
abstract = {Mathematical modeling of ecosystems requires a considerable amount of knowledge about the subsystems functioning within the broad framework and the various rate processes and transfer coefficients that control the dynamic aspects. A detailed analysis of the transfer rates and budget of inorganic carbon and nutrients in a simulated pond was conducted for assessment and comparison with aquatic bodies that undergo cultural eutrophication. In these systems the processes are complicated by a variety of inputs. Such inputs interfere with the assessment of lake background conditions and water quality. We used the compartmental model of biogeochemical cycling to calculate transfer rate of inorganic carbon and nutrients through various processes. The major external variables or forcing functions considered were light and temperature, while the state variables included the biotic and the abiotic compartments. The major processes studied were: photosynthesis, respiration and decomposition that play an important partin balancing the nutrient content of the system and maintain a dynamic equilibrium. The study illustrates how computational modeling studies are useful for analysis and management of systems for control and optimization of processes. The system shows a perfect cycling of carbon and the rate of withdrawal is equal to the return keeping the system in balance. About 0.284 m moles l(-1) is withdrawn from the reservoir for primary production each day and returned back through respiration and decomposition. The concentration of nitrates and phosphates resonate in tune with the utilization of carbon and productivity.},

METHODS: Neural networks is used for the prediction of preterm delivery, using various inputs such as the age of women, gestational age when the bleeding occurred, duration of the bleeding days, amount of bleeding, number of episodes, presence or absence of hematoma and placentation position. RESULTS: The success rate of prediction obtained using the feed forward backpropogation network is 70\%. Hence, this model can be used to identify women at the risk of premature delivery for planning antenatal care and clinical interventions in pregnancy.},

abstract = {Conservation strategies need to be both effective and efficient to be successful. To this end, two bodies of research should be integrated, namely 'resilience thinking' and 'optimisation for conservation,' both of which are highly policy relevant but to date have evolved largely separately. Resilience thinking provides an integrated perspective for analysis, emphasising the potential of nonlinear changes and the interdependency of social and ecological systems. By contrast, optimisation for conservation is an outcome-oriented tool that recognises resource scarcity and the need to make rational and transparent decisions. Here we propose that actively embedding optimisation analyses within a resilience-thinking framework could draw on the complementary strengths of the two bodies of work, thereby promoting cost-effective and enduring conservation outcomes.},

abstract = {Prediction of protein folding rates and folding nuclei is an important problem of protein science. Most of the previously proposed models for protein folding in vitro are based on the nucleation mechanism of this process. Our model considering protein folding as a flow arising in a network of folding-unfolding pathways at a coarse-grained free-energy landscape was described a few years ago, along with an algorithm for calculation of protein folding rates. Here we extend our approach and describe in detail a mathematically strict algorithm for calculating the "folding nuclei", arising as bottlenecks of the flow. Although the proposed physical theory uses no adjustable parameters, its results are in good agreement with experiment. This paper presents (i) the general theory and (ii) the results for the simplest case, i.e., folding/unfolding at the midpoint of thermodynamic equilibrium between the native and unfolded states of a protein; results for "in-water" conditions, i.e., for the case when no denaturant is added and the native state of a protein is much more stable than the unfolded one, will be described in the next paper of the series.},

abstract = {Background: Studies in Western countries have suggested that there are relationships among sex hormones, the neuropeptide leptin, women's food intake, and body weight changes across the menstrual cycle. However, data on this question are needed from other cultural groups. Objectives: To compare total food and macronutrient intake and serum estrogen, progesterone, and leptin levels in Taiwanese women of varying body size during three menstrual cycle phases. Method: A cross-sectional survey was conducted using a sample of 39 healthy Taiwanese women (aged 20-40 years) with regular menstrual cycles. Food journals covering 3 days, body weight, height, waist and hip circumferences, and serum samples for estrogen, progesterone, and leptin were collected at three time points during one menstrual cycle. Data were analyzed using the paired t test, mixed-model analysis, and Pearson's correlations. Results: Regardless of body weight, women consumed more total calories (+160 kcal/day, p < .05) and more grams of protein (+6-8 g/day, p = .01) during the luteal phase and ovulation compared with the follicular phase. A higher percentage of energy was consumed as carbohydrates (CHOs) during the follicular phase (+5\% of total energy intake, p < .01). No correlations were noted among serum sex hormone levels, serum leptin levels, food intake, and body weight. Discussion: The findings support the hypothesis that Taiwanese women, as previously reported in women from mixed or Western cultural groups, experience menstrual-related variations in food intake. These changes, however, were not directly linked with serum sex hormone or leptin levels.},

abstract = {Sorghum ranks fifth in worldwide economic importance among cereal crops and is one of the most important summer annual grasses of Pakistan. As it is a very diverse crop, sorghum genetic fingerprinting requires an efficient marker system. We estimated genetic divergence among 29 sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) genotypes, including approved varieties and local and exotic lines collected from different ecological regions of Pakistan, using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. A total of 125 RAPD loci, with an average of 66 loci per genotype, were used to calculate genetic divergence among these genotypes, of which 119 were polymorphic, showing 95\% overall polymorphism. Genetic similarity ranged from 0.36 to 0.92, indicating a relatively broad genetic base. RAPD analysis revealed maximum similarity between the Indian III and K-A-113 sorghum genotypes (both exotic lines), while the F-601 and F-606 were observed to be the most diverse genotypes. Mean band frequency revealed by these RAPD primers ranged from 0.17 to 0.56, with an average of 0.36. The data presented here support the findings that RAPDs can be effectively used for studying genetic diversity in sorghum.},

abstract = {Sorghum ranks fifth in worldwide economic importance among cereal crops and is one of the most important summer annual grasses of Pakistan. As it is a very diverse crop, sorghum genetic fingerprinting requires an efficient marker system. We estimated genetic divergence among 29 sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) genotypes, including approved varieties and local and exotic lines collected from different ecological regions of Pakistan, using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. A total of 125 RAPD loci, with an average of 66 loci per genotype, were used to calculate genetic divergence among these genotypes, of which 119 were polymorphic, showing 95\% overall polymorphism. Genetic similarity ranged from 0.36 to 0.92, indicating a relatively broad genetic base. RAPD analysis revealed maximum similarity between the Indian III and K-A-113 sorghum genotypes (both exotic lines), while the F-601 and F-606 were observed to be the most diverse genotypes. Mean band frequency revealed by these RAPD primers ranged from 0.17 to 0.56, with an average of 0.36. The data presented here support the findings that RAPDs can be effectively used for studying genetic diversity in sorghum.},

"The whole sequence of environniental changes can be viewed as changes in parameters or driving variables, and the long persistence in the face of these major changes suggests that natural systems have a high capacity to absorb change without dramatically altering. But this resilient character has its limits, and when the limits are passed, as by the construction of the Roman highway, the system rapidly changes to another condition."

        

        
Define resilience and stability
pg 17
"I propose that the behavior of ecological systems could well be dcfined by two distinct propertics: resilience and stability. Resilience determines the persistence of relationships within a system and is a measure of the ability of these systems to absorb changes of state variables, driving variables, and parameters, and still persist. In this definition resilience is the property of the system and persistence or probability of extinction is the result. Stability, on the other hand, is the ability of a system to return to an equilibrium state after a temporary disturbance.
The more rapidly it returns, and with the least fluctuation, the more stable it is. In this definition stability is the propcrty of the system and the degree of fluctuation around specific states the result."},

@article{Gunderson2000b,
abstract = {In 1973, C. S. Holling introduced the word resilience into the ecological literature as a way of helping to understand the non-linear dynamics observed in ecosystems. Ecological resilience was defined as the amount of disturbance that an ecosystem could withstand without changing self-organized processes and structures (defined as alternative stable states). Other authors consider resilience as a return time to a stable state following a perturbation. A new term, adaptive capacity, is introduced to describe the processes that modify ecological resilience. Two definitions recognize the presence of multiple stable states (or stability domains), and hence resilience is the property that mediates transition among these states. Transitions among stable states have been described for many ecosystems, including semi-arid rangelands, lakes, coral reefs, and forests. In these systems, ecological resilience is maintained by keystone structuring processes across a number of scales, sources of renewal and reformation, and functional biodiversity. In practice, maintaining a capacity for renewal in a dynamic environment provides an ecological buffer that protects the system from the failure of management actions that are taken based upon incomplete understanding, and it allows managers to affordably learn and change.},
annote = {This review is divided into three parts. The first section reviews concepts
and multiple meanings of resilience as they have appeared in the literature. That
section reviews examples of modeling and field experiments that enrich our
understanding of ecological change. The second section includes an assessment

@article{Beigl2008,
abstract = {The objective of this paper is to review previously published models of municipal solid waste generation and to propose an implementation guideline which will provide a compromise between information gain and cost-efficient model development. The 45 modelling approaches identified in a systematic literature review aim at explaining or estimating the present or future waste generation using economic, socio-demographic or management-orientated data. A classification was developed in order to categorise these highly heterogeneous models according to the following criteria--the regional scale, the modelled waste streams, the hypothesised independent variables and the modelling method. A procedural practice guideline was derived from a discussion of the underlying models in order to propose beneficial design options concerning regional sampling (i.e., number and size of observed areas), waste stream definition and investigation, selection of independent variables and model validation procedures. The practical application of the findings was demonstrated with two case studies performed on different regional scales, i.e., on a household and on a city level. The findings of this review are finally summarised in the form of a relevance tree for methodology selection.},

abstract = {Disaster risk management and mitigation are an important component of most business's tactical 
and strategic objectives. However, as time passes since the occurrence of disasters such as 9/11 
and hurricane Katrina, these managers are finding it much more difficult to gain budgetary 
approval for projects that increase disaster resilience with respect to business systems and 
processes. 

In this paper we will discuss and extend a conceptual disaster resilience framework developed by 
the Multidisciplinary Center for Earthquake Engineering Research (MCEER), suggest methods 
for quantifying organizational resilience, and apply the extended framework to an actual business 
disaster experienced by the Northrop Grumman Corporation. Focusing primarily on information 
technology functionality and infrastructure, we will provide specific examples of internal and 
external activities conducted by local staff members, as well as by Central Information 
Technology services from the Northrop Grumman corporate office that are excellent examples of 
organizational resilience. 

The intent of our future research is to supply business managers with a quantifiable approach to 
developing organizational resilience measurements that will enhance their business case for 
business continuity and resilience projects.

abstract = {Urban designers, ecologists, and social scientists have called for closer links among their disciplines. We examine a promising new tool for promoting this linkage--the metaphor of "cities of resilience." To put this tool to best use, we indicate how metaphor fits with other conceptual tools in science. We then present the two opposing definitions of resilience from ecology, and give reasons why one is more appropriate for linking with design. Additional specific tools and insights that are emerging from, or being increasingly used in, ecology can further support the linkage with urban design. These include recognizing the role of spatial heterogeneity in both ecological and social functioning of urban areas, the integrating power of watersheds, social and ecological patch dynamics of cities, the utility of spatial mosaic models to capture function, the use of an integrated "human ecosystem" modeling framework, and the consequent perspective of metropolitan areas as integrated ecological-social systems. Three additional tools are related to the adaptability of people and human institutions. First is the recognition of a "learning loop" in metropolitan ecosystems in which people respond to and affect ecological change, the use of urban design as experiments whose ecological and social outcomes can be measured, and finally the potency of a dialog between professionals and citizens, communities, and institutions, to support both research and design. The metaphor of resilience, and its technical specifications, draw these diverse strands for linking ecology and planning together.},

Our results suggest (1) neighborhoods in Washington County have increased in single-family dwelling unit density since the 1960's; (2) internal street connectivity and pedestrian access to commercial areas and bus stops have improved since the early 1990's; (2) external connectivity continues to decline; and (4) the mixing of land uses remains limited.

abstract = {This study empirically examines the connections between urban form and travel demand 
at the aggregate level using traffi c analysis zone data from Taipei, Taiwan, for the year 
2000. Nine latent variables and 26 observed variables were analysed using structural 
equation modelling. By clarifying the direct and indirect effects, the empirical evidence 
indicates that density is positively related to trip generation and negatively associated 
with private mode split; mixed land use reduces trip generation and indirectly in- 
creases private mode split and a pedestrian-friendly built environment signifi cantly 
reduces private mode split. Empirical evidence indicates that land use density, diversity 
and design affect travel demand in urban areas both directly and indirectly. 

Conclusions:
By clarifying the direct and indirect effects, 
the empirical evidence indicates that density 
is positively related to trip generation and 
negatively associated with private mode split; 
moreover, land use balance reduces trip gen- 
eration and thus indirectly increases private 
mode split, and pedestrian-friendly design 
reduces private mode split. Although the 
positive effect of mixed land use on private 
mode split is inconsistent with most North 
American studies, it is consistent with recent 
Asian studies and should be considered in 
urban development strategy. },

@article{Maat2005,
abstract = {Assumptions about the effects of various land-use characteristics on travel patterns have found their way into diverse concepts of planning and design, such as the compact city and neigh- bourhood-design principles. In general, these concepts aim at reducing travel distances and reducing car-travel speed, as it is assumed that as travel distances are shorter, individuals will travel less, and the relative competitive position of slower modes is increased. Although some literature supports the link between land use and travel behaviour, for the greater part limited effects have been concluded, whereas in others it has been concluded that there is virtually no effect. We argue that the effects fall short of the expectations advocated by the land-use concepts, because of shortcomings behind assumptions concerning the relationships between land use and travel behaviour. We argue that utility-based and activity-based theories add some extra insights. Various behavioural responses in terms of travel-time changes are possible, depending on whether travel time is minimised, benef its maximised, or activity patterns optimised. It is concluded that the contribution of compact urban designs to reduction on travel may not be as straightforward as is suggested by their advocates. In any case, a simplified distance-oriented and trip-oriented approach is unable to examine complex behaviour, and a broader framework of space and time is needed. notes: if it is assumed that people attempt to meet their basic needs within constraints of space and time, and performing trade-offs between utility and cost, it can be argued that an individual's aim is not primarily to minimise travel costs, but to maximise utility},

By viewing adoption and use of \{BIM\} as the inter-linkage of actors forming a building and construction project, the aim of the paper is to uncover mechanisms facilitating and constraining the creation of actor networks in which \{BIM\} is adopted and used. The aim is pursued by a case study in a major Swedish construction company. It is concluded that the possibility of incremental implementation of \{BIM\} applications is well aligned with the character of the industrial context. But the context can also constrain the use of applications requiring more long term thinking. However, because of the disruptive nature of building and construction projects, the challenge is to maintain and re-establish the network in which \{BIM\} is used in consecutive projects. When clients and regulating bodies recognize benefits from \{BIM\} usage, the main obstacle created by these characteristics of the industry will diminish.},

abstract = {The goal of the single building information model has existed for at least 30 years and various standards have been published leading up to the 10-year development of the industry foundation classes. These have been initiatives from researchers, software developers and standards committees. Now large property owners are becoming aware of the benefits of moving \{IT\} tools from specific applications towards more comprehensive solutions. This study addresses the state of building information models and the conditions necessary for them to become more widely used. It is a qualitative study based on information from a number of international experts and has asked a series of questions about the feasibility of \{BIMs,\} the conditions necessary for their success, and the role of standards with particular reference to the \{IFCs.\}
Some key statements were distilled from the diverse answers received and indicate that \{BIM\} solutions appear too complex for many and may need to be applied in limited areas initially. Standards are generally supported but not applied rigorously and a range of these are relevant to \{BIM.\} Benefits will depend upon the building procurement methods used and there should be special roles within the project team to manage information. Case studies are starting to appear and these could be used for publicity. The \{IFCs\} are rather oversold and their complexities should be hidden within simple-to-use software. Inevitably major questions remain and property owners may be the key to answering some of these. A framework for presenting standards, backed up by case studies of successful projects, is the solution proposed to provide better information on where particular \{BIM\} standards and solutions should be applied in building projects.},

abstract = {Virtual \{3D\} city models provide important information for different aspects of disaster management. In this context, up-to-dateness of and flexible access to \{3D\} city models are of utmost importance. Spatial Data Infrastructures \{(SDI)\} provide the appropriate framework to cover both aspects, integrating distributed data sources on demand. In this paper we present \{CityGML,\} a multi-purpose and multi-scale representation for the storage of and interoperable access to \{3D\} city models in \{SDIs.\} \{CityGML\} is based on the standard \{GML3\} of the Open Geospatial Consortium and covers the geometrical, topological, and semantic aspects of \{3D\} city models. The class taxonomy distinguishes between buildings and other man-made artifacts, vegetation objects, waterbodies, and transportation facilities like streets and railways. Spatial as well as semantic properties are structured in five consecutive levels of detail. Throughout the paper, special focus is on the utilization of model concepts with respect to different tasks in disaster management.},

A literature review of prior uses of the system dynamics method, focusing mainly on historic uses within civil and environmental engineering and related disciplines is first presented, to make the case for the applicability of the system dynamics method as a decision-making tool for building system design, retrofit, and operation. A proof-of-concept system dynamics model is presented for modeling of an elementary building system subjected to a bioterrorist attack. The proof-of-concept model includes evaluation of modifications to the building and its defenses. The results of the model simulation are presented and compared with previously published data. Use of the output data to improve decision-making in building design, retrofit, and operation is discussed. A method to link an electronic building information model \{(BIM)\} of the building to enable the electronic capture of the relevant building features in the system dynamics model is also discussed and demonstrated. Finally, future development of the model and other potential areas of applicability for the modeling methodology are discussed.},

Critical natural capital represents a multidimensional concept, as it mirrors the different frameworks of various scientific disciplines and social groups in valuing nature. This article revisits the concept of critical natural capital and examines its relation to the concept of ecological resilience. I propose that ecological resilience can help a great deal in specifying the [`]ecological criticality' of specific renewable parts of the natural capital. More specifically, I suggest that the degree of ecological resilience is inversely related to the degree of threat ecosystems are prone to. The concept of ecological resilience may complement other measures, such as integrity or vulnerability, in estimating the degree of threat specific ecosystems are exposed to. The empirical estimates of ecological resilience add a further criterion in order to build a comprehensive and clear conception of critical natural capital.},

abstract = {Resilience is widely seen as a desirable system property in environmental management. This paper explores the concept of resilience to natural hazards, using weather-related hazards in coastal megacities as an example. The paper draws on the wide literature on megacities, coastal hazards, hazard risk reduction strategies, and resilience within environmental management. Some analysts define resilience as a system attribute, whilst others use it as an umbrella concept for a range of system attributes deemed desirable. These umbrella concepts have not been made operational to support planning or management. It is recommended that resilience only be used in a restricted sense to describe specific system attributes concerning (i) the amount of disturbance a system can absorb and still remain within the same state or domain of attraction and (ii) the degree to which the system is capable of self-organisation. The concept of adaptive capacity, which has emerged in the context of climate change, can then be adopted as the umbrella concept, where resilience will be one factor influencing adaptive capacity. This improvement to conceptual clarity would foster much-needed communication between the natural hazards and the climate change communities and, more importantly, offers greater potential in application, especially when attempting to move away from disaster recovery to hazard prediction, disaster prevention, and preparedness.},

Worldwide changes to forests, farmlands, waterways, and air are being driven by the need to provide food, fiber, water, and shelter to more than six billion people. Global croplands, pastures, plantations, and urban areas have expanded in recent decades, accompanied by large increases in energy, water, and fertilizer consumption, along with considerable losses of biodiversity. Such changes in land use have enabled humans to appropriate an increasing share of the planet's resources, but they also potentially undermine the capacity of ecosystems to sustain food production, maintain freshwater and forest resources, regulate climate and air quality, and ameliorate infectious diseases. We face the challenge of managing trade-offs between immediate human needs and maintaining the capacity of the biosphere to provide goods and services in the long term.},

The novelty of the approach includes its incorporation of building design domain ontology, object-based \{CAD\} information modeling, and interoperability standard to make building information models and model data semantically interoperable. A set of methods are proposed to address the issues of object-based building information representation compliant with the Industrial Foundation Classes \{(IFC);\} extension of \{IFC\} models with the supplementary information; and semantic annotation of the interoperable and extensible information sets. The prototype implementation of these methods provides a set of Web-enabled software tools for effectively generating, managing, and reusing the semantically interoperable building objects in design applications of architectural \{CAD,\} structural analysis, and building code conformance checking.},

abstract = {Abstract Deliberate progress towards the goal of long-term sustainability depends on understanding the dynamics of linked social and ecological systems. The concept of social-ecological resilience holds promise for interdisciplinary syntheses. Resilience is a multifaceted concept that as yet has not been directly operationalized, particularly in systems for which our ignorance is such that detailed, parameter-rich simulation models are difficult to develop. We present an exploratory framework as a step towards the operationalization of resilience for empirical studies. We equate resilience with the ability of a system to maintain its identity, where system identity is defined as a property of key components and relationships (networks) and their continuity through space and time. Innovation and memory are also fundamental to understanding identity and resilience. By parsing our systems into the elements that we subjectively consider essential to identity, we obtain a small set of specific focal variables that reflect changes in identity. By assessing the potential for changes in identity under specified drivers and perturbations, in combination with a scenario-based approach to considering alternative futures, we obtain a surrogate measure of the current resilience of our study system as the likelihood of a change in system identity under clearly specified conditions, assumptions, drivers and perturbations. Although the details of individual case studies differ, the concept of identity provides a level of generality that can be used to compare measure of resilience across cases. Our approach will also yield insights into the mechanisms of change and the potential consequences of different policy and management decisions, providing a level of decision support for each case study area.},

abstract = {Assessing the economic impacts of urban land use transformation has become complex and acrimonious. Although community planners are beginning to comprehend the economic trade-offs inherent in transforming the urban fringe, they find it increasingly difficult to analyze and assess the trade-offs expediently and in ways that can influence local decision making. New and sophisticated spatial modeling techniques are now being applied to urban systems that can be used for assessing the probable spatial outcomes of given communal policies. Applying an economic impact assessment to the probable spatial patterns can provide to planners the tools needed to quickly assess scenarios for policy formation that might ultimately help inform decision makers.
This paper focuses on the theoretical underpinnings and the practical application of an economic impact analysis submodel developed within the Land Use Evolution and Impact Assessment Modeling \{(LEAM)\} environment. The conceptual framework of \{LEAM\} is described, followed by an application of the model to the assessment of the cost of urban sprawl in Kane County, Illinois. The high spatial resolution of the approach allows for discerning the macro-level implications of micro-level behaviors. The results show that spatially explicit dynamic modeling has various conceptual advantages over other approaches to modeling urban dynamics, both from a theoretical and a practical point of view. However, model validation and the assessment of the uncertainty of large-scale spatial dynamic models deserve considerable future attention. The implications of land use change decisions on individual and communal costs are discussed and ways to improve the methodology are outlined.},

abstract = {Between 2000 and 2030, cities in developing countries will double their population from 2 to 4 billion and at least triple their total built-up area. This essay assesses the state of preparedness for the projected urban expansion. The available anecdotal evidence suggests that areas needed for expansion are typically underestimated, that enforcement of land use regulations is relatively weak and cannot protect open space from development, and that essential arterial roads are commonly in short supply. The author proposes adopting a proactive strategy that does not overly rely on land use regulation, focusing instead on the layout and early acquisition of the right-of-way for an arterial road network, a 1-km-wide urban grid covering the entire area of expected expansion. This article reports on seven intermediate cities in Ecuador that are engaged in implementing this strategy, and examines the merits and pitfalls of pursuing it in Ecuador and elsewhere.},

abstract = {This research uses a longitudinal data set of commuting behavior to test the nature and strength of the association between residential change and employment location. Do households minimize commuting distances when they change residences and what are the differences for one-worker and two-worker households? The analysis utilizes descriptive measures of distance and time to work for pre- and post-residential relocations and develops estimates from a probability model of work-place attraction. We extend earlier research on commuting distances by using a multinodal rather than a monocentric city, by specifically considering the commuting responses of two-worker households and by formally estimating a model of the response to commuting distances. The findings indicate that both one- and two-worker households with greater separation between workplace and residence make decreases in distance and time. Overall, as other studies have shown, women commute shorter distances and are more likely to minimize commuting after a move than are men. The probability model fits the likelihood of decreasing distance with greater separation and provides a more exact specification of the connection between residence and workplace than previous analyses of this relationship.},

abstract = {Many studies have focused on the quantification of the input of materials into the economy. However, the insights provided by those studies have generally been limited. This paper attempts to bring analytical value to the discussion on "dematerialization" considering direct material input \{(DMI)\} per capita as the dependent variable in a test of the environmental Kuznets curve \{(EKC).\} The explanatory variable is, as usual, gross domestic product per capita. The quadratic and cubic versions of the \{EKC\} are tested econometrically, using panel data ranging from 1960 to 1998 for 16 industrialised countries. The results indicate a strong and robust support for both the quadratic and cubic \{EKC\} relationships between material input and income, in industrialised economies. While the statistical support to both types of evolution may seem contradictory, it suggests that as industrialised economies grow, the intensity of material consumption first increases, but eventually starts exhibiting a decreasing trend after a certain income threshold is reached. The \{inverted-U,\} or quadratic, relationship is confirmed, even though for the ranges of income considered in this study, the trend is mostly on the increasing part of the \{inverted-U\} curve. However, the statistical support to the cubic specification suggests that these results need to be regarded with caution. Overall, the statistically stronger models are the quadratic and cubic models with country random effects, and the cubic model with country and year fixed effects.},

abstract = {It is clear from the scale of anthropogenic resource use that economic systems should be brought within biophysical limits as soon as possible. One might assume that this task is difficult because it would involve identifying these limits, knowing when and where they are breached, and allocating responsibility. However, an intimate understanding of the natural limits to economic development may not be necessary for achieving a biophysically sustainable economy. Certain measurable features of the natural world are intimately connected with overall biophysical integrity, one such feature being biological diversity. A growing body of ecological research gives compelling evidence that biodiversity confers stability on ecosystems by buffering them against natural and artificial perturbations, and that it increases system productivity. It is well known that the stability and productivity of ecosystems are fundamental components of the earth's biophysical integrity. Therefore, biodiversity should act as a measure of biophysical integrity and biodiversity conservation might provide a viable framework for policies that drive economic activity towards overall biophysical sustainability. Economic instruments to implement a biodiversity constraint would penalise economic activities that directly or indirectly cause biodiversity loss and favour those that conserve it. A biodiversity constraint would, of course, require new legal and institutional underpinnings. What makes a biodiversity constraint doubly attractive is that it would also conserve the potentially large economic use and option values of biodiversity itself, thus removing the need for separate measures for its conservation.},

annote = {This article is the first of a two-part series that describes and compares the essential features of nine existing "physical economy" approaches for quantifying the material demands of the human economy upon the natural environment. A range of material flow analysis (MFA) and related techniques is assessed and compared in terms of several major dimensions. These include the system boundary identification for material flow sources, extents, and the key socioinstitutional entities containing relevant driving forces, as well as the nature and detailing of system components and flow interconnections, and the comprehensiveness and types of flows and materials covered. Shared conceptual themes of a new wave of physical economy approaches are described with a brief overview of the potential applications of this broad family of methodologies. The evolving and somewhat controversial nature of the characteristics and role that define MFA is examined. This review suggests the need to specify whether MFA is a general metabolic flow measurement procedure that can be applied from micro- to macrolevels of economic activity, or a more specific methodology aimed primarily at economy-wide analyses that "map" the material relations between society and nature. Some alternative options for classifying MFA are introduced for discussion before a more detailed comparative summary of the key methodological features of each approach in the second part of this two-part article. The review is presented (1) as a reference and resource for the increasing number of policy makers and practitioners involved in industrial ecology and the evaluation of the material basis of economies and the formulation of eco-efficiency strategies, and (2) to provoke discussion and ongoing dialogue to clarify the many existing areas of discordance in environmental accounting related to material flows, and help consolidate the methodological basis and application of MFA.},

abstract = {The sprawling patterns of land development common to metropolitan areas of the \{US\} have been blamed for high levels of automobile travel, and thus for air quality problems. In response, smart growth programs--designed to counter sprawl--have gained popularity in the \{US.\} Studies show that, all else equal, residents of neighborhoods with higher levels of density, land-use mix, transit accessibility, and pedestrian friendliness drive less than residents of neighborhoods with lower levels of these characteristics. These studies have shed little light, however, on the underlying direction of causality--in particular, whether neighborhood design influences travel behavior or whether travel preferences influence the choice of neighborhood. The evidence thus leaves a key question largely unanswered: if cities use land use policies to bring residents closer to destinations and provide viable alternatives to driving, will people drive less and thereby reduce emissions? Here a quasi-longitudinal design is used to investigate the relationship between neighborhood characteristics and travel behavior while taking into account the role of travel preferences and neighborhood preferences in explaining this relationship. A multivariate analysis of cross-sectional data shows that differences in travel behavior between suburban and traditional neighborhoods are largely explained by attitudes. However, a quasi-longitudinal analysis of changes in travel behavior and changes in the built environment shows significant associations, even when attitudes have been accounted for, providing support for a causal relationship.},

abstract = {Some tasks in the construction industry and urban management field such as site selection and fire response management are usually managed by using a Geographical Information System \{(GIS),\} as the tasks in these processes require a high level and amount of integrated geospatial information. Recently, a key element of this integrated geospatial information to emerge is detailed geometrical and semantic information about buildings. In parallel, Building Information Models \{(BIMs)\} of today have the capacity for storing and representing such detailed geometrical and semantic information. In this context, the research aimed to investigate the applicability of \{BIMs\} in geospatial environment by focusing specifically on these two domains; site selection and fire response management. In the first phase of the research two use case scenarios were developed in order to understand the processes in these domains in a more detailed manner and to establish the scope of a possible software development for transferring information from \{BIMs\} into the geospatial environment. In the following phase of the research two data models were developed - a \{Schema-Level\} Model View and a geospatial data model. The \{Schema-Level\} Model View was used in simplifying the information acquired from the \{BIM,\} while the geospatial data model acted as the template for creating physical files and databases in the geospatial environment. Following this, three software components to transfer building information into the geospatial environment were designed, developed, and validated. The first component served for acquiring the building information from the \{BIM,\} while the latter two served for transforming the information into the geospatial environment.
The overall research demonstrated that it is possible to transfer (high level of geometric and semantic) information acquired from \{BIMs\} into the geospatial environment. The results also demonstrated that \{BIMs\} provide a sufficient level and amount of (geometric and semantic) information (about the building) for the seamless automation of data management tasks in the site selection and fire response management processes.},

abstract = {A review of accessibility measures is presented for assessing the usability of these measures in evaluations of land-use and 
transport strategies and developments. Accessibility measures are reviewed using a broad range of relevant criteria, including 
theoretical basis, interpretability and communicability, and data requirements of the measures. Accessibility impacts of land-use and 
transport strategies are often evaluated using accessibility measures, which researchers and policy makers can easily operationalise 
and interpret, such as travelling speed, but which generally do not satisfy theoretical criteria. More complex and disaggregated 
accessibility measures, however, increase complexity and the effort for calculations and the difficulty of interpretation. The current 
practice can be much improved by operationalising more advanced location-based and utility-based accessibility measures that are 
still relatively easy to interpret for researchers and policy makers, and can be computed with state-of-the-practice data and/or land- 
use and transport models. Research directions towards theoretically more advanced accessibility measures point towards the 
inclusion of individual's spatial--temporal constraints and feedback mechanisms between accessibility, land-use and travel behav- 
iour. Furthermore, there is a need for theoretical and empirical research on relationships between accessibility, option values and 
non-user benefits, and the measurement of different components of accessibility.

abstract = {When analyzing the metabolism of our economy, the usual choice for a measure of resource consumption is the throughput of matter and energy. This, however, cannot be sufficient, since consumption by definition is always relating to the destruction or transformation, and hence a change in quality, not only in quantity, of material or energy flows. Here, an approach is presented that takes the entropy production associated with any process as a measure for the resource consumption of that process. Entropy production is thereby used to approximate the intuitive notion of consumption, which can best be described by the term loss of potential utility. This article delivers theoretical evidence for the validity of this choice, and a second article in a future issue will present an application taken from the metallurgical sector. The related concept of exergy analysis is discussed and compared against the entropy approach.},

abstract = {Advocates of New Urbanist and neo-traditional planning concepts include street connectivity as a key component for good neighborhood design. Street networks that are more grid-like are preferred over networks that include many cul-de-sacs and long blocks, thus increasing distances between destinations. The increased distances are thought to discourage walking and bicycling and, thus, physical activity. While intuitively attractive, there is limited empirical research at this time making this connection. There is also debate over how to measure connectivity and what levels of connectivity are appropriate. The objective of this research is to evaluate various measures of connectivity for the purpose of increasing walking and bicycling. Measures of connectivity can be useful in two arenas: (1) research linking travel behavior (and perhaps physical activity and health) to urban form; and (2) public policy establishing performance standards for new and/or existing development. This paper first defines and describes a wide range of measures of connectivity, drawn from multiple fields, including transportation, urban planning, geography, and landscape ecology. The paper then includes some preliminary results applying four measures of connectivity to the Portland, Oregon region.},

Travel and land-use are a function of one another, therefore it is often hypothesized that changing urban structure can result in changes in energy consumption. A popular view suggests that there is a strong negative correlation between urban density and energy consumption. This implies that increasing density will result in a reduction in energy consumption \{[Cities\} and Automobile Dependence: An International Sourcebook, Avebury Technical, Great Britain, 1989].
Using \{Co-Plot,\} an innovative multivariate statistical technique, this research crystallizes some of the relationships between density and energy consumption in western cities. The method is applied on Newman and Kenworthy's data, leading to the conclusion that there is no direct impact of total urban density. Instead several other relationships between energy consumption and density attributes can be identified.},

These changes raise questions such as: Who and what are vulnerable to the multiple environmental changes underway, and where? Research demonstrates that vulnerability is registered not by exposure to hazards (perturbations and stresses) alone but also resides in the sensitivity and resilience of the system experiencing such hazards. This recognition requires revisions and enlargements in the basic design of vulnerability assessments, including the capacity to treat coupled human-environment systems and those linkages within and without the systems that affect their vulnerability. A vulnerability framework for the assessment of coupled human-environment systems is presented.},

abstract = {The problems of urban sprawl have long been recognized. The classic response to sprawl has been compact settlements of one form or another. Yet the profession's modern origins stem from responses to overcrowding. Relieving crowding by letting in more light and air led to less compact urban form. This paradox remains unresolved despite recent compact city, smart growth, healthy community, and new urbanist efforts. This article reviews empirical data of whether compact cities are sustainable. Then, after reviewing current debates on sprawl and the compact city, it outlines the intellectual origins of sustainability and analyzes whether its theory supports the compact city hypothesis: compact is more sustainable than sprawl. It concludes that conceiving the city in terms of form is neither necessary nor sufficient to achieve the goals ascribed to the compact city. Instead, conceiving the city in terms of process holds more promise in attaining the elusive goal of a sustainable city.},

From the geographer's perspective, the gravity-based model reported in this research uses a well-known concept (the "potential") to offer an alternative explanation. Using numerical analysis techniques, the model simulates various urban density patterns. By varying the model's parameters (the distance friction coefficient [beta] and the city size), the numerical simulations do confirm two important empirical findings: the flattening of density gradients over time owing to transportation improvements, and flatter gradients in larger cities. The observed relationship between the [beta] value and the urban density gradient, as established by this research, opens an avenue for empirical testing.},

abstract = {Abstract This paper investigates how portability of a model between different computer operating systems can lead to increased efficiency
in code execution. The portability problem is not a trivial one, as many geographic models are designed to be run inside a
set environment \{(Unix,\} Solaris, Linux, and Windows), and are further limited by hardware constraints. The \{SLEUTH\} urban growth
model \{[K.C\} Clarke, S. Hoppen, and L. Gaydos. \{``A\} self-modifying cellular automaton model of historical urbanization in the
San Francisco Bay area'', Environment and Planning B, 24:247--261, 1997.] was implemented under three different operating systems \{(Solaris,\} Linux, and Windows). Results suggest
that the model's performance is optimized by porting it from its original environment \{(Unix/Solaris)\} to Linux or Windows where
faster processors are available. While the results show optimization of model performance, there are some suggestions of computational
bottlenecks that may eventually limit the increased performance of the model. Regardless, the research demonstrates that the
portability of a model can lead to not only to a decrease in computation time, but may increase the viability in practical
applications and attract a wider user base.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the relationship between absolute energy consumption and gross domestic product \{(GDP)\} per capita for 113 countries over the period 1971-2004. Energy has been scarcely explored in the Environmental Kuznets curve \{(EKC)\} debate and is taken as the indicator of overall environmental pressure. The following aspects of this work are rather innovative. Firstly, in order to closely adhere to the \{EKC\} narratives, the indicator of environmental pressure (energy) is taken in absolute terms rather than per capita. Secondly, we look for consistency both between different econometric techniques (parametric and semi-parametric) and across different analytical levels (world, time series/cross-countries, and single countries). Finally, the dataset is large and not limited to developed countries.
In our opinion, the estimates cannot support an \{energy-EKC\} hypothesis. For the world as a single unit, the relationship is positive monotone, with a lower (though still positive) elasticity after 1989. A glance at single country level does not reveal evidence of \{EKC.\} Cross-country analysis is slightly more open to interpretation; in any case, however, it shows that the potential benefits of \{GDP\} growth on natural environment, if any, did not show up in the considered time span.},

@article{Cervero1997,
abstract = {The built environment is thought to influence travel demand along three principal dimensions -density, diversity, and design. This paper tests this proposition by examining how the 3Ds affect trip rates and mode choice of residents in the San Francisco Bay Area. Using 1990 travel diary data and land-use records obtained from the \{U.S.\} census, regional inventories, and field surveys, models are estimated that relate features of the built environment to variations in vehicle miles traveled per household and mode choice, mainly for non-work trips. Factor analysis is used to linearly combine variables into the density and design dimensions of the built environment. The research finds that density, land-use diversity, and pedestrian-oriented designs generally reduce trip rates and encourage non-auto travel in statistically significant ways, though their influences appear to be fairly marginal. Elasticities between variables and factors that capture the \{3Ds\} and various measures of travel demand are generally in the 0.06 to 0.18 range, expressed in absolute terms. Compact development was found to exert the strongest influence on personal business trips. Within-neighborhood retail shops, on the other hand, were most strongly associated with mode choice for work trips. And while a factor capturing walking quality' was only moderately related to mode choice for non-work trips, those living in neighborhoods with grid-iron street designs and restricted commercial parking were nonetheless found to average significantly less vehicle miles of travel and rely less on single-occupant vehicles for non-work trips. Overall, this research shows that the elasticities between each dimension of the built environment and travel demand are modest to moderate, though certainly not inconsequential. Thus it supports the contention of new urbanists and others that creating more compact, diverse, and pedestrian-orientated neighborhoods, in combination, can meaningfully influence how Americans travel.},

abstract = {This paper summarizes remarks made by Vo-Tong Xuan, professor of agronomy at the University of Can Tho.  He states that agricultural production affects government market systems of supply and demand.  The aim of world food production is to supply more food with fewer resources to meet the needs of a growing global population, which may reach 8 billion by 2025.  Global food production needs to increase by 2\% annually.  Developing country food production needs to increase by 3\% annually.  There are needs for new land use patterns, improved crop choices, and market options and responsiveness.  Better national and regional food monitoring systems are needed, as well as appropriate farming systems.  Sustainability entails appropriate receipts for producer costs and affordable costs for consumers.  Yields must be increased while lowering production costs.  This may be achieved through the use of labor-intensive, low-input technology, increases in non-rice food crops, and changes in livestock and fishery production.  Food for livestock must not compete with human food demand.  Sustainable food production is dependent upon efficient use of irrigation systems, less consumption of rain water, integrated pest and nutrient management for reducing soil and water degradation, and high-yield, disease-resistant crop varieties suitable for a variety of land conditions.  Crop loss must be reduced and better weed management implemented.  Parliamentarians are important political resources for assuring the political will to make changes.  Several delegations were concerned about the low prices for rice.  Professor Xuan recommended reducing overproduction of rice, diversifying crops, and providing ready access to markets for food not consumed at home.  Individual subsidies were discouraged in favor of better land use planning.  Most delegates agreed that rice should be excluded from international trade agreements.},

abstract = {Recent case studies for individual locations and on individual urban challenges reveal the growing complexity of managing interrelations among population, infrastructure and institutions. Climate change is increasing the pressures on many urban systems and adding to this complexity. Many of the case studies investigating urban dynamics in the light of climate change have chosen narrow, sector-specific approaches. Few projects have built on insights from complexity theory and related bodies of knowledge which are more consistent with the perspective that urban infrastructure systems are tightly coupled with one another and must respond to often subtle, long-term changes of technological, social and environmental conditions. Drawing on that knowledge, and building on insights from previous case studies, this article explores the potential roles of complexity theory in guiding investment and policy decisions in the urban context. Policy and management that are consistent with insights from complexity theory will need to anticipate a wide array of potential trajectories for urban dynamics, identify and implement strategies that are robust under a range of potential developments, continuously innovate the policy-making and management institutions, and intensify the exchange of knowledge between science and \{society.Des\} \{\'{e}\}tudes de cas r\{\'{e}\}centes appliqu\{\'{e}\}es \{\`{a}\} des r\{\'{e}\}gions sp\{\'{e}\}cifiques et des d\{\'{e}\}fis urbains sp\{\'{e}\}cifiques r\{\'{e}\}v\{\`{e}\}lent une complexit\{\'{e}\} croissante dans la gestion des liens entre population, infrastructure et cadre institutionnel.

-review of multidisciplinary approaches to urban form
        
- classifyies quantitative approaches to analyzing urban form into five groups: 
landscape ecology
economic structure 
surface transportation
community design
urban design
        
        
Four conclusions are drawn. 
        
First, over the last two decades substantial progress has been made in the ability to measure and analyze spatial patterns that help characterize urban form.
        
Second, at multiples scales and for a variety of reasons, there are advantages to development that is mixed and compact.
        
Third, normative principles and policies for addressing urban form need to be crafted at multiple scales and carefully designed to address the disparate issues that arise at each scale.
        
Fourth, with so many disparate measures now used to operationalize the same constructs, it would advance urban form research to have some 
standardization in operational definitions and measurement protocols. 
        
$\backslash$citep\{Clifton2008\}
        
Issues of scale:
Too often, it is believed, principles of urban form are proposed without due consideration of multi-disciplinary perspectives and the scales at which such perspective might be most pertinent
        
Diversity:
Even after adjusting for differences in the cost of living, incomes tend to be higher in cities that are large and diverse.
        
Sprawl:
Research on urban sprawl at the submetropolitan level, generally conducted by transportation planners, focuses on accessibility.
        
quality design can substitute for personal space and thus make high-density development as, or even more, attractive than low-density development},

@techreport{Alinovi2009,
abstract = {Most of the current literature on food security focuses on assessing household vulnerability in 
food-insecure regions. However, although the concept of vulnerability is dynamic and 
forward-looking, almost all statistical methodologies applied until now have been static and 
unable to predict future events. The main reasons for this are conceptual -- for example, 
arising from the complexity (multidimensionality) of the concept of food security and the 
unpredictability of the many shocks that cause food insecurity -- and empirical, such as the 
absence of longitudinal data over sufficiently long periods to identify the various sources of 
risk and thereby allow the analysis of trends and risks. 
The concept of resilience has recently been introduced into food security literature. It aims 
to measure households' capability to absorb the negative effects of unpredictable shocks, as a 
legitimate component of vulnerability analysis. The definition of resilience to food insecurity 
has a direct effect on the methodology used to measure it, and the model described in this 
document, considers resilience to be a latent variable defined according to four building 
blocks: income and food access; assets; access to public services; and social safety nets. Two 
additional dimensions -- stability and adaptive capacity -- cut across these building blocks and 
account for households' capacity to respond and adapt to shocks; these too are latent 
variables. To measure the whole system, two approaches can be pursued. The first measures 
each dimension separately using different multivariate techniques (factor analysis, principal 
components analysis and optimal scaling) before estimating the resilience index; the 
classification and regression tree (CART) methodology has also been used for the 
understanding of the process. The second approach measures all the dimensions 
simultaneously through structural equation models, and is based on normality assumptions on 
observed variables. As most of the variables in resilience measurement are ordinal or 
categorical, the first approach was adopted in this document. 
The role of the estimated resilience index in measuring vulnerability to food insecurity was 
then assessed through a regression model with food consumption in logarithmic scale as a 
dependent variable and the resilience index and other household characteristics as 
independent variables. 
The document also discusses the policy implications of resilience, using the results of 
testing the methodology in the Palestinian context.

abstract = {Understanding different adaptive capacities is a prerequisite for targeting interventions to reduce the adverse impacts of climate change. Indicators and indices are common tools in this process, but their construction embodies many uncertainties, not least of which is their scale specificity. This paper describes the development of two empirical adaptive capacity indices for use at different scales of analysis: a national index for cross-country comparison in Africa and a household index for cross-household comparison in a village in Limpopo province, South Africa. Explaining the decisions made at each stage of construction illuminates the degree of uncertainty involved when assessing adaptive capacity, and how this uncertainty is compounded when looking across different scales of analysis. It concludes that the central elements of adaptive capacity, based on institutional collective response and the availability of and access to resources, are common at different scales, although the structure of each index is scale-specific. Hence the findings of these apparently irreconcilable scales of analysis converge to demonstrate points of leverage for policy intervention to raise resilience and the capacity to adapt to the risks posed by climate change.},

Indicators that incorporate a measure of system resilience would provide useful information on system sustainability. Through development of a new indicator, Water Provision Resilience \{(WPR),\} we provide an example of how measures of resilience could be incorporated into sustainability indicators. The new indicator adds six color codings to the existing indicator [`]percent of the population with access to safe water.' Each color coding represents a measure of the ability of the water system to maintain or improve the current percent of the population with access to safe water in key areas of the water provision sector: supply, infrastructure, service provision, finances, water quality and governance. The metric is then applied to three cities. The goal in developing this metric is to provide a starting point for re-thinking the metrics used to measure progress and sustainability in order to incorporate the ability to absorb and adapt to stresses into sustainability analysis.},

abstract = {Urban areas and their voracious appetites are increasingly dominating the flows of energy and materials around the globe. Understanding the size distribution and dynamics of urban areas is vital if we are to manage their growth and mitigate their negative impacts on global ecosystems. For over 50 years, city size distributions have been assumed to universally follow a power function, and many theories have been put forth to explain what has become known as Zipf's law (the instance where the exponent of the power function equals unity). Most previous studies, however, only include the largest cities that comprise the tail of the distribution. Here we show that national, regional and continental city size distributions, whether based on census data or inferred from cluster areas of remotely-sensed nighttime lights, are in fact lognormally distributed through the majority of cities and only approach power functions for the largest cities in the distribution tails. To explore generating processes, we use a simple model incorporating only two basic human dynamics, migration and reproduction, that nonetheless generates distributions very similar to those found empirically.

@article{Mokhtarian2008,
abstract = {Numerous studies have found that suburban residents drive more and walk less than residents in traditional neighbor- 
hoods. What is less well understood is the extent to which the observed patterns of travel behavior can be attributed to the 
residential built environment itself, as opposed to the prior self-selection of residents into a built environment that is con- 
sistent with their predispositions toward certain travel modes and land use configurations. To date, most studies addressing 
this attitudinal self-selection issue fall into seven categories: direct questioning, statistical control, instrumental variables 
models, sample selection models, joint discrete choice models, structural equations models, and longitudinal designs. This 
paper reviews and evaluates these alternative approaches with respect to this particular application (a companion paper 
focuses on the empirical findings of 28 studies using these approaches). We identify some advantages and disadvantages 
of each approach, and note the difficulties in actually quantifying the absolute and/or relative extent of the true influence of 
the built environment on travel behavior. Although time and resource limitations are recognized, we recommend usage of 
longitudinal structural equations modeling with control groups, a design which is strong with respect to all causality 
requisites.

Equations for determining emissions are developed for contributions from: electricity; heating and industrial fuels; ground transportation fuels; air and marine fuels; industrial processes; and waste. Gasoline consumption is estimated using three approaches: from local fuel sales; by scaling from regional fuel sales; and from counts of vehicle kilometres travelled. A simplified version of an intergovernmental panel on climate change \{(IPCC)\} method for estimating the \{GHG\} emissions from landfill waste is applied. Three measures of overall emissions are suggested: (i) actual emissions within the boundary of the city; (ii) single process emissions (from a life-cycle perspective) associated with the city's metabolism; and (iii) life-cycle emissions associated with the city's metabolism. The results and analysis of the study will be published in a second paper.},

abstract = {China is home to one-fifth of the world's population and that population is increasingly urban. The landscape is also urbanizing. Although there are studies that focus on specific elements of urban growth, there is very little empirical work that incorporates feedbacks and linkages to assess the interactions between the dynamics of urban growth and their environmental impacts. In this study, we develop a system dynamics simulation model of the drivers and environmental impacts of urban growth, using Shenzhen, South China, as a case study. We identify three phases of urban growth and develop scenarios to evaluate the impact of urban growth on several environmental indicators: land use, air quality, and demand for water and energy. The results show that all developable land will be urban by 2020 and the increase in the number of vehicles will be a major source of air pollution. Demand for water and electricity will rise, and the city will become increasingly vulnerable to shortages of either. The scenarios also show that there will be improvements in local environmental quality as a result of increasing affluence and economic growth. However, the environmental impacts outside of Shenzhen may increase as demands for natural resources increase and Shenzhen pushes its manufacturing industries out of the municipality. The findings may also portend to changes other cities in China and elsewhere in the developing world may experience as they continue to industrialize.},

This paper uses 1985 data for 247 large county areas to determine the separate impacts on local government spending of two dimensions of residential development patterns, the rapidity of population growth and the intensity of land use as measured by gross residential densities. Based on a regression model that controls for other determinants of per capita spending, this study provides careful estimates of the nonlinear impacts of population growth and population density on three types of local government spending: current account spending, capital outlays and spending on public safety. The study balances the engineering and planning view that greater population density lowers the costs of providing public services by documenting a U-shaped relationship between spending and density; except in sparsely populated areas, higher density typically increases public sector spending. In addition, the results suggest that rapid population growth imposes fiscal burdens on established residents in the form of lower service levels.},

annote = {The growing industrial metabolism is a major driver of global environmental change. We present an assessment of the global use of materials since the beginning of the 20th century based on the conceptual and methodological principles of material flow accounting (MFA). On the grounds of published statistical data, data compilations and estimation procedures for material flows not covered by international statistical sources, we compiled a quantitative estimate of annual global extraction of biomass, fossil energy carriers, metal ores, industrial minerals and construction minerals for the period 1900 to 2005. This period covers important phases of global industrialisation and economic growth. The paper analyses the observed changes in the overall size and composition of global material flows in relation to the global economy, population growth and primary energy consumption. We show that during the last century, global materials use increased 8-fold. Humanity currently uses almost 60 billion tons (Gt) of materials per year. In particular, the period after WWII was characterized by rapid physical growth, driven by both population and economic growth. Within this period there was a shift from the dominance of renewable biomass towards mineral materials. Materials use increased at a slower pace than the global economy, but faster than world population. As a consequence, material intensity (i.e. the amount of materials required per unit of GDP) declined, while materials use per capita doubled from 4.6 to 10.3 t/cap/yr. The main material groups show different trajectories. While biomass use hardly keeps up with population growth, the mineral fractions grow at a rapid pace. We show that increases in material productivity are mostly due to the slow growth of biomass use, while they are much less pronounced for the mineral fractions. So far there is no evidence that growth of global materials use is slowing down or might eventually decline and our results indicate that an increase in material productivity is a general feature of economic development.},

abstract = {Resource flows constitute the materials basis of the economy. At the same time, they carry and induce an environmental burden associated with resource extraction and the subsequent material flows and stocks, which finally end up as waste and emissions. A reduction of this material throughput and the related impacts would require a reduction of resource inputs. And breaking the link between resource consumption and economic growth would require an increase in resource productivity. Material flow analysis \{(MFA)\} can be used to quantify resource flows and indicate resource productivity. In this article, we study the available empirical evidence on the actual (de-)linkage of material resource use and economic growth. We compare resource use with respect to total material requirement \{(TMR)\} and direct material input \{(DMI)\} for 11 and 26 countries, respectively, and the European Union \{(EU-15).\} The dynamics of \{TMR,\} as well as of the main components are analysed in relation to economic growth in order to show whether there is a decoupling (relative or absolute) from \{GDP\} and a change of the metabolic structure in the course of economic development. \{DMI/cap\} so far only decoupled from \{GDP/cap\} in relative terms; that is, in most countries, it reached a rather constant level but--with the exception of Czech Republic--showed no absolute decline yet. \{TMR/cap\} was reduced in two high-income countries and one low-income country due to political influence. Changes in \{TMR\} were more influenced by hidden flows \{(HF)\} than by \{DMI.\} We analyse the dynamics of the structure and composition of \{TMR\} in the course of economic development. In general, the economic development of industrial countries was accompanied by a shift from domestic to foreign resource extraction. Different relations can be discovered for the share of biomass, fossil fuel resources, construction resources and metals and industrial minerals.},

It suggests that the existing paradigm ought to be more flexible, particularly if the sustainable mobility agenda is to become a reality. The second part argues that policy measures are available to improve urban sustainability in transport terms but that the main challenges relate to the necessary conditions for change. These conditions are dependent upon high-quality implementation of innovative schemes, and the need to gain public confidence and acceptability to support these measures through active involvement and action. Seven key elements of sustainable mobility are outlined, so that public acceptability can be more effectively promoted.},

The results of the bounds test show that there is a stable long run relationship amongst total energy consumption, population, \{GDP\} \{(Gross\} domestic product) and urbanization level when total energy consumption is the dependent variable in China. The results of the causality test with \{ECM\} (error correction model) specification, the short run and long run dynamics of the interested variables are tested, indicating that there exists only a unidirectional Granger causality running from urbanization to total energy consumption both in the long run and in the short run. At present, the contribution share which urbanization drags the energy consumption is smaller than that in the past, and the intensity holds a downward trend. Therefore, together with enhancing energy efficiency, accelerating the urbanization process that can cut reliance on resource and energy dependent industries is a fundamental strategy to solve the sustainable development dilemma between energy consumption and urbanization.},

Published research results have so far tended to be either verbal discussions of the overall concept of \{CIC\} and its potential benefits, or descriptions of some restricted aspects of the overall \{CIC\} process using formalized data or activity modelling tools.
This paper attempts to extend the scope of such formalized approaches by suggesting how object-oriented conceptual modelling techniques, which until now have been used mainly for product modelling, could be used to define a framework for the overall information management in a construction project. Such a framework could be used as a basis for the development of more detailed standards, placing them in a more general context. It could also help in setting strategies for the development of construction computing applications, which in due time will become parts of a \{CIC\} environment.},

abstract = {Transportation is a major source of greenhouse gas \{(GHG)\} emissions and the most rapidly growing anthropogenic source. In the future, the developing world will account for the largest share of transport \{GHG\} increases. Four basic components drive transportation energy consumption and \{GHG\} emissions: activities \{(A),\} mode share \{(S),\} fuel intensity \{(I)\} and fuel choice \{(F)\} \{(ASIF).\} Currently, the Kyoto Protocol's clean development mechanism \{(CDM)\} serves as the main international market-based tool designed to reduce \{GHG\} emissions from the developing world. Theoretically, the \{CDM\} has the dual purpose of helping developing countries achieve "sustainable development" goals and industrialized countries meet their Kyoto emissions reduction commitments. This paper reviews overall \{CDM\} activities and transportation \{CDM\} activities to date and then presents findings from three case studies of transportation \{CDM\} possibilities examined with the \{ASIF\} framework in Santiago de Chile. The analysis suggests that bus technology switch \{(I)\} provides a fairly good project fit for the \{CDM,\} while options aimed at inducing mode share \{(S)\} to bicycle, or modifying travel demand via land use changes \{(ASI)\} face considerable challenges. The implications of the findings for the \{CDM\} and the \{"post-Kyoto"\} world are discussed.},

A number of previous studies have assessed vulnerability of infrastructure systems to various hazards such as earthquakes, but seldom have the impacts of post disaster policies been considered. In its assessment of the water system in post disaster situation after Bam earthquake, this paper examines the impacts of various reconstruction as well as water management policies on the system failure in operation in terms of the ability of Bam urban water system to meet increased demand trends. Adopting a system dynamics modeling approach and the concept of viability loops, the paper will show that in order to minimize further crisis in the water system during the reconstruction period stricter water management policies need to be considered.},

abstract = {Land-change science has emerged as a foundational element of global environment change and sustainability science. It seeks to understand the human and environment dynamics that give rise to changed land uses and covers, not only in terms of their type and magnitude but their location as well. This focus requires the integration of social, natural, and geographical information sciences. Each of these broad research communities has developed different ways to enter the land-change problem, each with different means of treating the locational specificity of the critical variables, such as linking the land manager to the parcel being managed. The resulting integration encounters various data, methodological, and analytical problems, especially those concerning aggregation and inference, land-use pixel links, data and measurement, and remote sensing analysis. Here, these integration problems, which hinder comprehensive understanding and theory development, are addressed. Their recognition and resolution are required for the sustained development of land-change science.},

abstract = {There is growing interest in incorporating urban form indicators into transportation planning and travel analysis. These indicators typically are measured at a certain level of spatial aggregation (e.g., traffic analysis zone) and therefore are subject to the modifiable areal unit problem \{(MAUP)\} known primarily in the statistical and geographic literature but generally overlooked by transportation researchers. The presence of the \{MAUP\} can cause serious inconsistency in analytical results and consequently misinform policy making. This study diagnoses the \{MAUP\} in measuring urban form through empirical modeling of travel mode choice in the Boston, Massachusetts, region. Using data aggregated in grids with five cell sizes and at the transportation analysis zone, the census block group, and the block level, the study explores the sensitivity of coefficient estimates for population density, network pattern, and land use balance to data aggregation in predicting mode choice decisions. Having confirmed the presence of the \{MAUP,\} the study discusses three approaches for dealing with it. Using a grid with a cell size of 1/2 mi appears to be the most desirable method of data aggregation among the eight methods studied. The suggested improvements in methodology will help advance the inquiry on the link between urban form and travel.},

annote = {We present the concept of sociometabolic regimes and use it to analyze patterns of change in global social metabolism. Sociometabolic regimes represent dynamic equilibria of society-nature interactions and are characterized by typical patterns of material and energy flows (metabolic profiles). From this perspective, industrialization appears as a process of transition from the agrarian to the industrial regime. This article presents a global data set on the socioeconomic metabolism of 175 nations for the year 2000. We group the countries into six clusters differentiated by economic development and population density, reflecting the historical path of (agrarian) development and resource endowment. Our analysis reveals that per capita material and energy use in industrialized clusters is higher than in developing regions by a factor of 5 to 10. However, per capita use of natural resources differs significantly among industrialized clusters. A large fraction of the global population displays a metabolic profile somewhere in between the patterns typical for the agrarian and the industrial regimes. The sociometabolic transition from an agrarian to an industrial regime is thus an ongoing process with important consequences for future global material and energy demand. If we take a transition between regimes and the current characteristics of this transition as given, the global energy and materials demand is likely to grow by a factor of 2 to 3 during the coming decades. The most critical part of our findings relates to the cluster of high-density developing countries, as these countries already have a higher anthropogenic material and energy burden per unit of land area than, for example, industrial Europe, with pending further increases bound to surpass carrying capacities.},

abstract = {Four propositions drawn from 60 years of natural hazard and reconstruction research provide a comparative and historical perspective on the reconstruction of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. Decisions taken over its 288-year history that have made New Orleans so vulnerable to Katrina reflect a long-term pattern of societal response to hazard events--reducing consequences to relatively frequent events, and increasing vulnerability to very large and rare events. Thus Katrina's consequences for New Orleans were truly catastrophic--accounting for most of the estimated 1,570 deaths of Louisiana residents and \$40-50 billion in monetary losses. A comparative sequence and timing of recovery provides a calendar of historical experience against which to gauge progress in reconstruction. Using this calendar, the emergency post-disaster period appears to be longer in duration than that of any other studied disaster. The restoration period, the time taken to restore urban services for the smaller population, is in keeping with or ahead of historical experience. The effort to reconstruct the physical environment and urban infrastructure is likely to take 8-11 years. Conflicting policy goals for reconstruction of rapid recovery, safety, betterment, and equity are already evident. Actions taken demonstrate the rush to rebuild the familiar in contrast to planning efforts that emphasize betterment. Because disasters tend to accelerate existing economic, social, and political trends, the large losses in housing, population, and employment after Katrina are likely to persist and, at best, only partly recover. However, the possibility of breaking free of this gloomy trajectory is feasible and has some historical precedent.},

A critical review of these topics is offered, along with the current conditions and hopes for each one of them, and for the city as a whole.},

abstract = {Long House Valley in the Black Mesa area of northeastern Arizona (U.S.) was inhabited by the Kayenta Anasazi from about 1800 before Christ to about anno Domini 1300. These people were prehistoric ancestors of the modern Pueblo cultures of the Colorado Plateau. Paleoenvironmental research based on alluvial geomorphology, palynology, and dendroclimatology permits accurate quantitative reconstruction of annual fluctuations in potential agricultural production (kg of maize per hectare). The archaeological record of Anasazi farming groups from anno Domini 200-1300 provides information on a millennium of sociocultural stasis, variability, change, and adaptation. We report on a multiagent computational model of this society that closely reproduces the main features of its actual history, including population ebb and flow, changing spatial settlement patterns, and eventual rapid decline. The agents in the model are monoagriculturalists, who decide both where to situate their fields as well as the location of their settlements. Nutritional needs constrain fertility. Agent heterogeneity, difficult to model mathematically, is demonstrated to be crucial to the high fidelity of the model.},

abstract = {Despite a century of effort, our understanding of how cities evolve is still woefully inadequate. Recent research, however, suggests that cities are complex systems that mainly grow from the bottom up, their size and shape following well-defined scaling laws that result from intense competition for space. An integrated theory of how cities evolve, linking urban economics and transportation behavior to developments in network science, allometric growth, and fractal geometry, is being slowly developed. This science provides new insights into the resource limits facing cities in terms of the meaning of density, compactness, and sprawl, and related questions of sustainability. It has the potential to enrich current approaches to city planning and replace traditional top-down strategies with realistic city plans that benefit all city dwellers.},

abstract = {Physical inactivity is one of the most important public health issues in the U.S. and internationally. Increasingly, links are being identified between various elements of the physical-or built-environment and physical activity. To understand the impact of the built environment on physical activity, the development of high-quality measures is essential. Three categories of built environment data are being used: (1) perceived measures obtained by telephone interview or self-administered questionnaires; (2) observational measures obtained using systematic observational methods (audits); and (3) archival data sets that are often layered and analyzed with GIS. This review provides a critical assessment of these three types of built-environment measures relevant to the study of physical activity. Among perceived measures, 19 questionnaires were reviewed, ranging in length from 7 to 68 questions. Twenty audit tools were reviewed that cover community environments (i.e., neighborhoods, cities), parks, and trails. For GIS-derived measures, more than 50 studies were reviewed. A large degree of variability was found in the operationalization of common GIS measures, which include population density, land-use mix, access to recreational facilities, and street pattern. This first comprehensive examination of built-environment measures demonstrates considerable progress over the past decade, showing diverse environmental variables available that use multiple modes of assessment. Most can be considered first-generation measures, so further development is needed. In particular, further research is needed to improve the technical quality of measures, understand the relevance to various population groups, and understand the utility of measures for science and public health.},

@article{Kates2006a,
abstract = {Four propositions drawn from 60 years of natural hazard and reconstruction research provide a comparative and historical perspective on the reconstruction of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. Decisions taken over its 288-year history that have made New Orleans so vulnerable to Katrina reflect a long-term pattern of societal response to hazard events--reducing consequences to relatively frequent events, and increasing vulnerability to very large and rare events. Thus Katrina's consequences for New Orleans were truly catastrophic--accounting for most of the estimated 1,570 deaths of Louisiana residents and \$40-50 billion in monetary losses. A comparative sequence and timing of recovery provides a calendar of historical experience against which to gauge progress in reconstruction. Using this calendar, the emergency post-disaster period appears to be longer in duration than that of any other studied disaster. The restoration period, the time taken to restore urban services for the smaller population, is in keeping with or ahead of historical experience. The effort to reconstruct the physical environment and urban infrastructure is likely to take 8-11 years. Conflicting policy goals for reconstruction of rapid recovery, safety, betterment, and equity are already evident. Actions taken demonstrate the rush to rebuild the familiar in contrast to planning efforts that emphasize betterment. Because disasters tend to accelerate existing economic, social, and political trends, the large losses in housing, population, and employment after Katrina are likely to persist and, at best, only partly recover. However, the possibility of breaking free of this gloomy trajectory is feasible and has some historical precedent.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Randomized controlled trials have shown several beneficial effects of intraoperative bispectral index monitoring. We conducted a prospective audit to determine whether these could be replicated in everyday clinical practice. METHODS: Recovery characteristics and drug costs from two 4-week periods were compared, immediately before (phase 1, n = 427 patients) and after (phase 2, n = 299 patients) the introduction of bispectral index monitoring in the main operating theatres of a district general hospital. RESULTS: Demographic and intraoperative variables for the two patient groups were similar. Nausea (P = 0.002), vomiting (P = 0.008) and antiemetic use (P = 0.001) in the postanaesthesia care unit all decreased in phase 2, though unrelated changes in antiemetic policy may have been partly responsible. Recovery time was unaffected. Drug costs decreased in phase 2 by an average of 0.86 pounds per patient. The cost of each semi-reusable sensor was 6.60 pounds. CONCLUSION: In a prospective audit, benefits of intraoperative bispectral index monitoring in our district general hospital were not seen to the same degree as in randomized controlled trials elsewhere.},

@article{Xuan2005a,
abstract = {This paper summarizes remarks made by Vo-Tong Xuan, professor of agronomy at the University of Can Tho.  He states that agricultural production affects government market systems of supply and demand.  The aim of world food production is to supply more food with fewer resources to meet the needs of a growing global population, which may reach 8 billion by 2025.  Global food production needs to increase by 2\% annually.  Developing country food production needs to increase by 3\% annually.  There are needs for new land use patterns, improved crop choices, and market options and responsiveness.  Better national and regional food monitoring systems are needed, as well as appropriate farming systems.  Sustainability entails appropriate receipts for producer costs and affordable costs for consumers.  Yields must be increased while lowering production costs.  This may be achieved through the use of labor-intensive, low-input technology, increases in non-rice food crops, and changes in livestock and fishery production.  Food for livestock must not compete with human food demand.  Sustainable food production is dependent upon efficient use of irrigation systems, less consumption of rain water, integrated pest and nutrient management for reducing soil and water degradation, and high-yield, disease-resistant crop varieties suitable for a variety of land conditions.  Crop loss must be reduced and better weed management implemented.  Parliamentarians are important political resources for assuring the political will to make changes.  Several delegations were concerned about the low prices for rice.  Professor Xuan recommended reducing overproduction of rice, diversifying crops, and providing ready access to markets for food not consumed at home.  Individual subsidies were discouraged in favor of better land use planning.  Most delegates agreed that rice should be excluded from international trade agreements.},

abstract = {The vulnerability framework of the Research and Assessment Systems for Sustainability Program explicitly recognizes the coupled human-environment system and accounts for interactions in the coupling affecting the system's responses to hazards and its vulnerability. This paper illustrates the usefulness of the vulnerability framework through three case studies: the tropical southern Yucat\'{a}n, the arid Yaqui Valley of northwest Mexico, and the pan-Arctic. Together, these examples illustrate the role of external forces in reshaping the systems in question and their vulnerability to environmental hazards, as well as the different capacities of stakeholders, based on their access to social and biophysical capital, to respond to the changes and hazards. The framework proves useful in directing attention to the interacting parts of the coupled system and helps identify gaps in information and understanding relevant to reducing vulnerability in the systems as a whole.},

@article{Turner2003d,
abstract = {Global environmental change and sustainability science increasingly recognize the need to address the consequences of changes taking place in the structure and function of the biosphere. These changes raise questions such as: Who and what are vulnerable to the multiple environmental changes underway, and where? Research demonstrates that vulnerability is registered not by exposure to hazards (perturbations and stresses) alone but also resides in the sensitivity and resilience of the system experiencing such hazards. This recognition requires revisions and enlargements in the basic design of vulnerability assessments, including the capacity to treat coupled human-environment systems and those linkages within and without the systems that affect their vulnerability. A vulnerability framework for the assessment of coupled human-environment systems is presented.},

We use this algorithm to generate networks with exponential, power law, and Poisson degree distributions with variable levels of clustering. Such networks may be used as models of social networks and as a testable null hypothesis about network structure. Finally, we explore the effects of clustering on the point of the phase transition where a giant component forms in a random network, and on the size of the giant component. Some analysis of these effects is presented.},

abstract = {Input-output analysis has been adapted to calculate the total (direct plus indirect) energy required to produce goods and services in the U.S. economy; this quantity has been termed the embodied energy. Usually, the energy required to produce labor and government services and the solar energy input to the economy are ignored by analysts. The former omission can be traced to the assumption that traditional primary factors of economic production-land, labor, and capital-are independent. A strong case can be made that these input factors are not independent and that energy is required for their production. Embodied energies can be calculated in this case by using input-output data. The results of such an analysis show that there is a strong relation between embodied energy and dollar value for a 92-sector U.S. economy if the energy required to produce labor and government services is included.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This paper illustrates a retrospective study of the outcome of those pregnancies that continued from an initial episode of bleeding in first trimester. METHODS: Neural networks is used for the prediction of preterm delivery, using various inputs such as the age of women, gestational age when the bleeding occurred, duration of the bleeding days, amount of bleeding, number of episodes, presence or absence of hematoma and placentation position. RESULTS: The success rate of prediction obtained using the feed forward backpropogation network is 70\%. Hence, this model can be used to identify women at the risk of premature delivery for planning antenatal care and clinical interventions in pregnancy.},

abstract = {Prediction of protein folding rates and folding nuclei is an important problem of protein science. Most of the previously proposed models for protein folding in vitro are based on the nucleation mechanism of this process. Our model considering protein folding as a flow arising in a network of folding-unfolding pathways at a coarse-grained free-energy landscape was described a few years ago, along with an algorithm for calculation of protein folding rates. Here we extend our approach and describe in detail a mathematically strict algorithm for calculating the "folding nuclei", arising as bottlenecks of the flow. Although the proposed physical theory uses no adjustable parameters, its results are in good agreement with experiment. This paper presents (i) the general theory and (ii) the results for the simplest case, i.e., folding/unfolding at the midpoint of thermodynamic equilibrium between the native and unfolded states of a protein; results for "in-water" conditions, i.e., for the case when no denaturant is added and the native state of a protein is much more stable than the unfolded one, will be described in the next paper of the series.},

abstract = {It is clear from the scale of anthropogenic resource use that economic systems should be brought within biophysical limits as soon as possible. One might assume that this task is difficult because it would involve identifying these limits, knowing when and where they are breached, and allocating responsibility. However, an intimate understanding of the natural limits to economic development may not be necessary for achieving a biophysically sustainable economy. Certain measurable features of the natural world are intimately connected with overall biophysical integrity, one such feature being biological diversity. A growing body of ecological research gives compelling evidence that biodiversity confers stability on ecosystems by buffering them against natural and artificial perturbations, and that it increases system productivity. It is well known that the stability and productivity of ecosystems are fundamental components of the earth's biophysical integrity. Therefore, biodiversity should act as a measure of biophysical integrity and biodiversity conservation might provide a viable framework for policies that drive economic activity towards overall biophysical sustainability. Economic instruments to implement a biodiversity constraint would penalise economic activities that directly or indirectly cause biodiversity loss and favour those that conserve it. A biodiversity constraint would, of course, require new legal and institutional underpinnings. What makes a biodiversity constraint doubly attractive is that it would also conserve the potentially large economic use and option values of biodiversity itself, thus removing the need for separate measures for its conservation.},

abstract = {The development and use of indicators is common practice in efforts to promote urban sustainability. Indicators used to measure urban sustainability tend to focus narrowly on describing the current state of the urban system. Although a time series analysis using these indicators may lend insights into trends towards or away from certain [`]sustainability' goals, existing indicators of urban sustainability do not provide information on the ability or the likelihood that the current system state can be maintained or improved over time. Indicators that incorporate a measure of system resilience would provide useful information on system sustainability. Through development of a new indicator, Water Provision Resilience \{(WPR),\} we provide an example of how measures of resilience could be incorporated into sustainability indicators. The new indicator adds six color codings to the existing indicator [`]percent of the population with access to safe water.' Each color coding represents a measure of the ability of the water system to maintain or improve the current percent of the population with access to safe water in key areas of the water provision sector: supply, infrastructure, service provision, finances, water quality and governance. The metric is then applied to three cities. The goal in developing this metric is to provide a starting point for re-thinking the metrics used to measure progress and sustainability in order to incorporate the ability to absorb and adapt to stresses into sustainability analysis.},

Critical natural capital represents a multidimensional concept, as it mirrors the different frameworks of various scientific disciplines and social groups in valuing nature. This article revisits the concept of critical natural capital and examines its relation to the concept of ecological resilience. I propose that ecological resilience can help a great deal in specifying the [`]ecological criticality' of specific renewable parts of the natural capital. More specifically, I suggest that the degree of ecological resilience is inversely related to the degree of threat ecosystems are prone to. The concept of ecological resilience may complement other measures, such as integrity or vulnerability, in estimating the degree of threat specific ecosystems are exposed to. The empirical estimates of ecological resilience add a further criterion in order to build a comprehensive and clear conception of critical natural capital.},

abstract = {Recent case studies for individual locations and on individual urban challenges reveal the growing complexity of managing interrelations among population, infrastructure and institutions. Climate change is increasing the pressures on many urban systems and adding to this complexity. Many of the case studies investigating urban dynamics in the light of climate change have chosen narrow, sector-specific approaches. Few projects have built on insights from complexity theory and related bodies of knowledge which are more consistent with the perspective that urban infrastructure systems are tightly coupled with one another and must respond to often subtle, long-term changes of technological, social and environmental conditions. Drawing on that knowledge, and building on insights from previous case studies, this article explores the potential roles of complexity theory in guiding investment and policy decisions in the urban context. Policy and management that are consistent with insights from complexity theory will need to anticipate a wide array of potential trajectories for urban dynamics, identify and implement strategies that are robust under a range of potential developments, continuously innovate the policy-making and management institutions, and intensify the exchange of knowledge between science and \{society.Des\} \{\'{e}\}tudes de cas r\{\'{e}\}centes appliqu\{\'{e}\}es \{\`{a}\} des r\{\'{e}\}gions sp\{\'{e}\}cifiques et des d\{\'{e}\}fis urbains sp\{\'{e}\}cifiques r\{\'{e}\}v\{\`{e}\}lent une complexit\{\'{e}\} croissante dans la gestion des liens entre population, infrastructure et cadre institutionnel.

abstract = {Abstract Deliberate progress towards the goal of long-term sustainability depends on understanding the dynamics of linked social and
ecological systems. The concept of social-ecological resilience holds promise for interdisciplinary syntheses. Resilience
is a multifaceted concept that as yet has not been directly operationalized, particularly in systems for which our ignorance
is such that detailed, parameter-rich simulation models are difficult to develop. We present an exploratory framework as a
step towards the operationalization of resilience for empirical studies. We equate resilience with the ability of a system
to maintain its identity, where system identity is defined as a property of key components and relationships (networks) and
their continuity through space and time. Innovation and memory are also fundamental to understanding identity and resilience.
By parsing our systems into the elements that we subjectively consider essential to identity, we obtain a small set of specific
focal variables that reflect changes in identity. By assessing the potential for changes in identity under specified drivers
and perturbations, in combination with a scenario-based approach to considering alternative futures, we obtain a surrogate
measure of the current resilience of our study system as the likelihood of a change in system identity under clearly specified
conditions, assumptions, drivers and perturbations. Although the details of individual case studies differ, the concept of
identity provides a level of generality that can be used to compare measure of resilience across cases. Our approach will
also yield insights into the mechanisms of change and the potential consequences of different policy and management decisions,
providing a level of decision support for each case study area.},

abstract = {Urban designers, ecologists, and social scientists have called for closer links among their disciplines. We examine a promising new tool for promoting this linkage--the metaphor of "cities of resilience." To put this tool to best use, we indicate how metaphor fits with other conceptual tools in science. We then present the two opposing definitions of resilience from ecology, and give reasons why one is more appropriate for linking with design. Additional specific tools and insights that are emerging from, or being increasingly used in, ecology can further support the linkage with urban design. These include recognizing the role of spatial heterogeneity in both ecological and social functioning of urban areas, the integrating power of watersheds, social and ecological patch dynamics of cities, the utility of spatial mosaic models to capture function, the use of an integrated "human ecosystem" modeling framework, and the consequent perspective of metropolitan areas as integrated ecological-social systems. Three additional tools are related to the adaptability of people and human institutions. First is the recognition of a "learning loop" in metropolitan ecosystems in which people respond to and affect ecological change, the use of urban design as experiments whose ecological and social outcomes can be measured, and finally the potency of a dialog between professionals and citizens, communities, and institutions, to support both research and design. The metaphor of resilience, and its technical specifications, draw these diverse strands for linking ecology and planning together.},

abstract = {China is home to one-fifth of the world's population and that population is increasingly urban. The landscape is also urbanizing. Although there are studies that focus on specific elements of urban growth, there is very little empirical work that incorporates feedbacks and linkages to assess the interactions between the dynamics of urban growth and their environmental impacts. In this study, we develop a system dynamics simulation model of the drivers and environmental impacts of urban growth, using Shenzhen, South China, as a case study. We identify three phases of urban growth and develop scenarios to evaluate the impact of urban growth on several environmental indicators: land use, air quality, and demand for water and energy. The results show that all developable land will be urban by 2020 and the increase in the number of vehicles will be a major source of air pollution. Demand for water and electricity will rise, and the city will become increasingly vulnerable to shortages of either. The scenarios also show that there will be improvements in local environmental quality as a result of increasing affluence and economic growth. However, the environmental impacts outside of Shenzhen may increase as demands for natural resources increase and Shenzhen pushes its manufacturing industries out of the municipality. The findings may also portend to changes other cities in China and elsewhere in the developing world may experience as they continue to industrialize.},

A proof-of-concept system dynamics model is presented for modeling of an elementary building system subjected to a bioterrorist attack. The proof-of-concept model includes evaluation of modifications to the building and its defenses. The results of the model simulation are presented and compared with previously published data. Use of the output data to improve decision-making in building design, retrofit, and operation is discussed. A method to link an electronic building information model \{(BIM)\} of the building to enable the electronic capture of the relevant building features in the system dynamics model is also discussed and demonstrated. Finally, future development of the model and other potential areas of applicability for the modeling methodology are discussed.},

abstract = {Nowadays cities are seen as motors for the sustainable development of European regions and are thus of crucial importance for the future of Europe as a whole. Management of complex systems such as cities requires the use of innovative, sophisticated planning tools that can assist in monitoring current conditions and projecting future developments. In this paper an integrated approach is proposed towards the development and implementation of a generic city planning framework that in principle can be applied to any city. The proposed city planning framework is a combination of an information system and a dynamic model, which enables the instrument to be used in both strategic and operational manners.},

abstract = {Abstract Quick restoration of critical infrastructure systems, such as water, electrical power, natural gas, and transportation systems,
are essential for rapid and effective post disaster recovery and reconstruction process. A number of previous studies have
assessed vulnerability of infrastructure systems to various hazards such as earthquakes, but seldom have the impacts of post
disaster policies been considered. In its assessment of the water system in post disaster situation after Bam earthquake,
this paper examines the impacts of various reconstruction as well as water management policies on the system failure in operation
in terms of the ability of Bam urban water system to meet increased demand trends. Adopting a system dynamics modeling approach
and the concept of viability loops, the paper will show that in order to minimize further crisis in the water system during
the reconstruction period stricter water management policies need to be considered.},

abstract = {Background: Studies in Western countries have suggested that there are relationships among sex hormones, the neuropeptide leptin, women's food intake, and body weight changes across the menstrual cycle. However, data on this question are needed from other cultural groups. Objectives: To compare total food and macronutrient intake and serum estrogen, progesterone, and leptin levels in Taiwanese women of varying body size during three menstrual cycle phases. Method: A cross-sectional survey was conducted using a sample of 39 healthy Taiwanese women (aged 20-40 years) with regular menstrual cycles. Food journals covering 3 days, body weight, height, waist and hip circumferences, and serum samples for estrogen, progesterone, and leptin were collected at three time points during one menstrual cycle. Data were analyzed using the paired t test, mixed-model analysis, and Pearson's correlations. Results: Regardless of body weight, women consumed more total calories (+160 kcal/day, p < .05) and more grams of protein (+6-8 g/day, p = .01) during the luteal phase and ovulation compared with the follicular phase. A higher percentage of energy was consumed as carbohydrates (CHOs) during the follicular phase (+5\% of total energy intake, p < .01). No correlations were noted among serum sex hormone levels, serum leptin levels, food intake, and body weight. Discussion: The findings support the hypothesis that Taiwanese women, as previously reported in women from mixed or Western cultural groups, experience menstrual-related variations in food intake. These changes, however, were not directly linked with serum sex hormone or leptin levels.},

abstract = {Sorghum ranks fifth in worldwide economic importance among cereal crops and is one of the most important summer annual grasses of Pakistan. As it is a very diverse crop, sorghum genetic fingerprinting requires an efficient marker system. We estimated genetic divergence among 29 sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) genotypes, including approved varieties and local and exotic lines collected from different ecological regions of Pakistan, using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. A total of 125 RAPD loci, with an average of 66 loci per genotype, were used to calculate genetic divergence among these genotypes, of which 119 were polymorphic, showing 95\% overall polymorphism. Genetic similarity ranged from 0.36 to 0.92, indicating a relatively broad genetic base. RAPD analysis revealed maximum similarity between the Indian III and K-A-113 sorghum genotypes (both exotic lines), while the F-601 and F-606 were observed to be the most diverse genotypes. Mean band frequency revealed by these RAPD primers ranged from 0.17 to 0.56, with an average of 0.36. The data presented here support the findings that RAPDs can be effectively used for studying genetic diversity in sorghum.},

abstract = {In 1973, C. S. Holling introduced the word resilience into the ecological literature as a way of helping to understand the non-linear dynamics observed in ecosystems. Ecological resilience was defined as the amount of disturbance that an ecosystem could withstand without changing self-organized processes and structures (defined as alternative stable states). Other authors consider resilience as a return time to a stable state following a perturbation. A new term, adaptive capacity, is introduced to describe the processes that modify ecological resilience. Two definitions recognize the presence of multiple stable states (or stability domains), and hence resilience is the property that mediates transition among these states. Transitions among stable states have been described for many ecosystems, including semi-arid rangelands, lakes, coral reefs, and forests. In these systems, ecological resilience is maintained by keystone structuring processes across a number of scales, sources of renewal and reformation, and functional biodiversity. In practice, maintaining a capacity for renewal in a dynamic environment provides an ecological buffer that protects the system from the failure of management actions that are taken based upon incomplete understanding, and it allows managers to affordably learn and change.},

abstract = {China is home to one-fifth of the world's population and that population is increasingly urban. The landscape is also urbanizing. Although there are studies that focus on specific elements of urban growth, there is very little empirical work that incorporates feedbacks and linkages to assess the interactions between the dynamics of urban growth and their environmental impacts. In this study, we develop a system dynamics simulation model of the drivers and environmental impacts of urban growth, using Shenzhen, South China, as a case study. We identify three phases of urban growth and develop scenarios to evaluate the impact of urban growth on several environmental indicators: land use, air quality, and demand for water and energy. The results show that all developable land will be urban by 2020 and the increase in the number of vehicles will be a major source of air pollution. Demand for water and electricity will rise, and the city will become increasingly vulnerable to shortages of either. The scenarios also show that there will be improvements in local environmental quality as a result of increasing affluence and economic growth. However, the environmental impacts outside of Shenzhen may increase as demands for natural resources increase and Shenzhen pushes its manufacturing industries out of the municipality. The findings may also portend to changes other cities in China and elsewhere in the developing world may experience as they continue to industrialize.},

abstract = {Abstract Deliberate progress towards the goal of long-term sustainability depends on understanding the dynamics of linked social and ecological systems. The concept of social-ecological resilience holds promise for interdisciplinary syntheses. Resilience is a multifaceted concept that as yet has not been directly operationalized, particularly in systems for which our ignorance is such that detailed, parameter-rich simulation models are difficult to develop. We present an exploratory framework as a step towards the operationalization of resilience for empirical studies. We equate resilience with the ability of a system to maintain its identity, where system identity is defined as a property of key components and relationships (networks) and their continuity through space and time. Innovation and memory are also fundamental to understanding identity and resilience. By parsing our systems into the elements that we subjectively consider essential to identity, we obtain a small set of specific focal variables that reflect changes in identity. By assessing the potential for changes in identity under specified drivers and perturbations, in combination with a scenario-based approach to considering alternative futures, we obtain a surrogate measure of the current resilience of our study system as the likelihood of a change in system identity under clearly specified conditions, assumptions, drivers and perturbations. Although the details of individual case studies differ, the concept of identity provides a level of generality that can be used to compare measure of resilience across cases. Our approach will also yield insights into the mechanisms of change and the potential consequences of different policy and management decisions, providing a level of decision support for each case study area.},

RESULTS: The success rate of prediction obtained using the feed forward backpropogation network is 70\%. Hence, this model can be used to identify women at the risk of premature delivery for planning antenatal care and clinical interventions in pregnancy.},

abstract = {Recent case studies for individual locations and on individual urban challenges reveal the growing complexity of managing interrelations among population, infrastructure and institutions. Climate change is increasing the pressures on many urban systems and adding to this complexity. Many of the case studies investigating urban dynamics in the light of climate change have chosen narrow, sector-specific approaches. Few projects have built on insights from complexity theory and related bodies of knowledge which are more consistent with the perspective that urban infrastructure systems are tightly coupled with one another and must respond to often subtle, long-term changes of technological, social and environmental conditions. Drawing on that knowledge, and building on insights from previous case studies, this article explores the potential roles of complexity theory in guiding investment and policy decisions in the urban context. Policy and management that are consistent with insights from complexity theory will need to anticipate a wide array of potential trajectories for urban dynamics, identify and implement strategies that are robust under a range of potential developments, continuously innovate the policy-making and management institutions, and intensify the exchange of knowledge between science and \{society.Des\} \{\'{e}\}tudes de cas r\{\'{e}\}centes appliqu\{\'{e}\}es \{\`{a}\} des r\{\'{e}\}gions sp\{\'{e}\}cifiques et des d\{\'{e}\}fis urbains sp\{\'{e}\}cifiques r\{\'{e}\}v\{\`{e}\}lent une complexit\{\'{e}\} croissante dans la gestion des liens entre population, infrastructure et cadre institutionnel.

Critical natural capital represents a multidimensional concept, as it mirrors the different frameworks of various scientific disciplines and social groups in valuing nature. This article revisits the concept of critical natural capital and examines its relation to the concept of ecological resilience. I propose that ecological resilience can help a great deal in specifying the [`]ecological criticality' of specific renewable parts of the natural capital. More specifically, I suggest that the degree of ecological resilience is inversely related to the degree of threat ecosystems are prone to. The concept of ecological resilience may complement other measures, such as integrity or vulnerability, in estimating the degree of threat specific ecosystems are exposed to. The empirical estimates of ecological resilience add a further criterion in order to build a comprehensive and clear conception of critical natural capital.},

A proof-of-concept system dynamics model is presented for modeling of an elementary building system subjected to a bioterrorist attack. The proof-of-concept model includes evaluation of modifications to the building and its defenses. The results of the model simulation are presented and compared with previously published data. Use of the output data to improve decision-making in building design, retrofit, and operation is discussed. A method to link an electronic building information model \{(BIM)\} of the building to enable the electronic capture of the relevant building features in the system dynamics model is also discussed and demonstrated.

Most of the previously proposed models for protein folding in vitro are based on the nucleation mechanism of this process. Our model considering protein folding as a flow arising in a network of folding-unfolding pathways at a coarse-grained free-energy landscape was described a few years ago, along with an algorithm for calculation of protein folding rates. Here we extend our approach and describe in detail a mathematically strict algorithm for calculating the "folding nuclei", arising as bottlenecks of the flow. Although the proposed physical theory uses no adjustable parameters, its results are in good agreement with experiment. This paper presents (i) the general theory and (ii) the results for the simplest case, i.e., folding/unfolding at the midpoint of thermodynamic equilibrium between the native and unfolded states of a protein; results for "in-water" conditions, i.e., for the case when no denaturant is added and the native state of a protein is much more stable than the unfolded one, will be described in the next paper of the series.},

abstract = {Nowadays cities are seen as motors for the sustainable development of European regions and are thus of crucial importance for the future of Europe as a whole. Management of complex systems such as cities requires the use of innovative, sophisticated planning tools that can assist in monitoring current conditions and projecting future developments. In this paper an integrated approach is proposed towards the development and implementation of a generic city planning framework that in principle can be applied to any city. The proposed city planning framework is a combination of an information system and a dynamic model, which enables the instrument to be used in both strategic and operational manners.},

@article{Smith1996,
abstract = {It is clear from the scale of anthropogenic resource use that economic systems should be brought within biophysical limits as soon as possible. One might assume that this task is difficult because it would involve identifying these limits, knowing when and where they are breached, and allocating responsibility. However, an intimate understanding of the natural limits to economic development may not be necessary for achieving a biophysically sustainable economy. Certain measurable features of the natural world are intimately connected with overall biophysical integrity, one such feature being biological diversity. A growing body of ecological research gives compelling evidence that biodiversity confers stability on ecosystems by buffering them against natural and artificial perturbations, and that it increases system productivity. It is well known that the stability and productivity of ecosystems are fundamental components of the earth's biophysical integrity. Therefore, biodiversity should act as a measure of biophysical integrity and biodiversity conservation might provide a viable framework for policies that drive economic activity towards overall biophysical sustainability. Economic instruments to implement a biodiversity constraint would penalise economic activities that directly or indirectly cause biodiversity loss and favour those that conserve it. A biodiversity constraint would, of course, require new legal and institutional underpinnings. What makes a biodiversity constraint doubly attractive is that it would also conserve the potentially large economic use and option values of biodiversity itself, thus removing the need for separate measures for its conservation.},

are essential for rapid and effective post disaster recovery and reconstruction process. A number of previous studies have
assessed vulnerability of infrastructure systems to various hazards such as earthquakes, but seldom have the impacts of post
disaster policies been considered. In its assessment of the water system in post disaster situation after Bam earthquake,
this paper examines the impacts of various reconstruction as well as water management policies on the system failure in operation
in terms of the ability of Bam urban water system to meet increased demand trends. Adopting a system dynamics modeling approach
and the concept of viability loops, the paper will show that in order to minimize further crisis in the water system during
the reconstruction period stricter water management policies need to be considered.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The September 2008 melamine outbreak in China has adversely affected perceptions of food safety among consumers. This paper presents a survey of the perception of food safety and willingness to pay for certified traceable (CT) food among the citizens of Jiangsu Province. It presents the critical necessity of establishing a food traceability system (FTS) to address possible similar outbreaks in the future. RESULTS: The results show that 36\% of the respondents are strongly dissatisfied with food safety conditions in the province. Only 37\% of the respondents have heard of FTS. Among the respondents who chose to buy CT food, 32\% were unwilling to shoulder the extra cost. The consumers' overall satisfaction with food safety, awareness of FTS, gender, age, educational level and income are the main determinants of Chinese consumers' willingness to pay for CT food. CONCLUSION: Based on the results, it is proposed that the Chinese government pay attention to the mentality of its citizens when establishing an FTS and take measures to lift consumers' willingness to pay for CT food. Results of this study will provide valuable insights to developing countries.},

abstract = {Background: Studies in Western countries have suggested that there are relationships among sex hormones, the neuropeptide leptin, women's food intake, and body weight changes across the menstrual cycle. However, data on this question are needed from other cultural groups. Objectives: To compare total food and macronutrient intake and serum estrogen, progesterone, and leptin levels in Taiwanese women of varying body size during three menstrual cycle phases. Method: A cross-sectional survey was conducted using a sample of 39 healthy Taiwanese women (aged 20-40 years) with regular menstrual cycles. Food journals covering 3 days, body weight, height, waist and hip circumferences, and serum samples for estrogen, progesterone, and leptin were collected at three time points during one menstrual cycle. Data were analyzed using the paired t test, mixed-model analysis, and Pearson's correlations. Results: Regardless of body weight, women consumed more total calories (+160 kcal/day, p < .05) and more grams of protein (+6-8 g/day, p = .01) during the luteal phase and ovulation compared with the follicular phase. A higher percentage of energy was consumed as carbohydrates (CHOs) during the follicular phase (+5\% of total energy intake, p < .01). No correlations were noted among serum sex hormone levels, serum leptin levels, food intake, and body weight. Discussion: The findings support the hypothesis that Taiwanese women, as previously reported in women from mixed or Western cultural groups, experience menstrual-related variations in food intake. These changes, however, were not directly linked with serum sex hormone or leptin levels.},

This paper illustrates the usefulness of the vulnerability framework through three case studies: the tropical southern Yucat\'{a}n, the arid Yaqui Valley of northwest Mexico, and the pan-Arctic. Together, these examples illustrate the role of external forces in reshaping the systems in question and their vulnerability to environmental hazards, as well as the different capacities of stakeholders, based on their access to social and biophysical capital, to respond to the changes and hazards. The framework proves useful in directing attention to the interacting parts of the coupled system and helps identify gaps in information and understanding relevant to reducing vulnerability in the systems as a whole.},

@article{Kates2006a,
abstract = {Four propositions drawn from 60 years of natural hazard and reconstruction research provide a comparative and historical perspective on the reconstruction of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. Decisions taken over its 288-year history that have made New Orleans so vulnerable to Katrina reflect a long-term pattern of societal response to hazard events--reducing consequences to relatively frequent events, and increasing vulnerability to very large and rare events. Thus Katrina's consequences for New Orleans were truly catastrophic--accounting for most of the estimated 1,570 deaths of Louisiana residents and \$40-50 billion in monetary losses. A comparative sequence and timing of recovery provides a calendar of historical experience against which to gauge progress in reconstruction. Using this calendar, the emergency post-disaster period appears to be longer in duration than that of any other studied disaster. The restoration period, the time taken to restore urban services for the smaller population, is in keeping with or ahead of historical experience. The effort to reconstruct the physical environment and urban infrastructure is likely to take 8-11 years. Conflicting policy goals for reconstruction of rapid recovery, safety, betterment, and equity are already evident. Actions taken demonstrate the rush to rebuild the familiar in contrast to planning efforts that emphasize betterment. Because disasters tend to accelerate existing economic, social, and political trends, the large losses in housing, population, and employment after Katrina are likely to persist and, at best, only partly recover. However, the possibility of breaking free of this gloomy trajectory is feasible and has some historical precedent.},

@article{Cumming2005,
abstract = {Abstract Deliberate progress towards the goal of long-term sustainability depends on understanding the dynamics of linked social and ecological systems. The concept of social-ecological resilience holds promise for interdisciplinary syntheses. Resilience is a multifaceted concept that as yet has not been directly operationalized, particularly in systems for which our ignorance is such that detailed, parameter-rich simulation models are difficult to develop. We present an exploratory framework as a step towards the operationalization of resilience for empirical studies. We equate resilience with the ability of a system to maintain its identity, where system identity is defined as a property of key components and relationships (networks) and their continuity through space and time. Innovation and memory are also fundamental to understanding identity and resilience. By parsing our systems into the elements that we subjectively consider essential to identity, we obtain a small set of specific focal variables that reflect changes in identity. By assessing the potential for changes in identity under specified drivers and perturbations, in combination with a scenario-based approach to considering alternative futures, we obtain a surrogate measure of the current resilience of our study system as the likelihood of a change in system identity under clearly specified conditions, assumptions, drivers and perturbations. Although the details of individual case studies differ, the concept of identity provides a level of generality that can be used to compare measure of resilience across cases. Our approach will also yield insights into the mechanisms of change and the potential consequences of different policy and management decisions, providing a level of decision support for each case study area.},

@article{Mukherjee2009,
abstract = {Mathematical modeling of ecosystems requires a considerable amount of knowledge about the subsystems functioning within the broad framework and the various rate processes and transfer coefficients that control the dynamic aspects. A detailed analysis of the transfer rates and budget of inorganic carbon and nutrients in a simulated pond was conducted for assessment and comparison with aquatic bodies that undergo cultural eutrophication. In these systems the processes are complicated by a variety of inputs. Such inputs interfere with the assessment of lake background conditions and water quality. We used the compartmental model of biogeochemical cycling to calculate transfer rate of inorganic carbon and nutrients through various processes. The major external variables or forcing functions considered were light and temperature, while the state variables included the biotic and the abiotic compartments. The major processes studied were: photosynthesis, respiration and decomposition that play an important partin balancing the nutrient content of the system and maintain a dynamic equilibrium. The study illustrates how computational modeling studies are useful for analysis and management of systems for control and optimization of processes. The system shows a perfect cycling of carbon and the rate of withdrawal is equal to the return keeping the system in balance. About 0.284 m moles l(-1) is withdrawn from the reservoir for primary production each day and returned back through respiration and decomposition. The concentration of nitrates and phosphates resonate in tune with the utilization of carbon and productivity.},

abstract = {Conservation strategies need to be both effective and efficient to be successful. To this end, two bodies of research should be integrated, namely 'resilience thinking' and 'optimisation for conservation,' both of which are highly policy relevant but to date have evolved largely separately. Resilience thinking provides an integrated perspective for analysis, emphasising the potential of nonlinear changes and the interdependency of social and ecological systems. By contrast, optimisation for conservation is an outcome-oriented tool that recognises resource scarcity and the need to make rational and transparent decisions. Here we propose that actively embedding optimisation analyses within a resilience-thinking framework could draw on the complementary strengths of the two bodies of work, thereby promoting cost-effective and enduring conservation outcomes.},

These changes raise questions such as: Who and what are vulnerable to the multiple environmental changes underway, and where? Research demonstrates that vulnerability is registered not by exposure to hazards (perturbations and stresses) alone but also resides in the sensitivity and resilience of the system experiencing such hazards. This recognition requires revisions and enlargements in the basic design of vulnerability assessments, including the capacity to treat coupled human-environment systems and those linkages within and without the systems that affect their vulnerability. A vulnerability framework for the assessment of coupled human-environment systems is presented.},

abstract = {In 1973, C. S. Holling introduced the word resilience into the ecological literature as a way of helping to understand the non-linear dynamics observed in ecosystems. Ecological resilience was defined as the amount of disturbance that an ecosystem could withstand without changing self-organized processes and structures (defined as alternative stable states). Other authors consider resilience as a return time to a stable state following a perturbation. A new term, adaptive capacity, is introduced to describe the processes that modify ecological resilience. Two definitions recognize the presence of multiple stable states (or stability domains), and hence resilience is the property that mediates transition among these states. Transitions among stable states have been described for many ecosystems, including semi-arid rangelands, lakes, coral reefs, and forests. In these systems, ecological resilience is maintained by keystone structuring processes across a number of scales, sources of renewal and reformation, and functional biodiversity. In practice, maintaining a capacity for renewal in a dynamic environment provides an ecological buffer that protects the system from the failure of management actions that are taken based upon incomplete understanding, and it allows managers to affordably learn and change.},

abstract = {Despite a century of effort, our understanding of how cities evolve is still woefully inadequate. Recent research, however, suggests that cities are complex systems that mainly grow from the bottom up, their size and shape following well-defined scaling laws that result from intense competition for space. An integrated theory of how cities evolve, linking urban economics and transportation behavior to developments in network science, allometric growth, and fractal geometry, is being slowly developed. This science provides new insights into the resource limits facing cities in terms of the meaning of density, compactness, and sprawl, and related questions of sustainability. It has the potential to enrich current approaches to city planning and replace traditional top-down strategies with realistic city plans that benefit all city dwellers.},

abstract = {The maintenance of critical natural capital is an important objective of sustainable development. Critical natural capital represents a multidimensional concept, as it mirrors the different frameworks of various scientific disciplines and social groups in valuing nature. This article revisits the concept of critical natural capital and examines its relation to the concept of ecological resilience. I propose that ecological resilience can help a great deal in specifying the [`]ecological criticality' of specific renewable parts of the natural capital. More specifically, I suggest that the degree of ecological resilience is inversely related to the degree of threat ecosystems are prone to. The concept of ecological resilience may complement other measures, such as integrity or vulnerability, in estimating the degree of threat specific ecosystems are exposed to. The empirical estimates of ecological resilience add a further criterion in order to build a comprehensive and clear conception of critical natural capital.},

abstract = {It is clear from the scale of anthropogenic resource use that economic systems should be brought within biophysical limits as soon as possible. One might assume that this task is difficult because it would involve identifying these limits, knowing when and where they are breached, and allocating responsibility. However, an intimate understanding of the natural limits to economic development may not be necessary for achieving a biophysically sustainable economy. Certain measurable features of the natural world are intimately connected with overall biophysical integrity, one such feature being biological diversity. A growing body of ecological research gives compelling evidence that biodiversity confers stability on ecosystems by buffering them against natural and artificial perturbations, and that it increases system productivity. It is well known that the stability and productivity of ecosystems are fundamental components of the earth's biophysical integrity. Therefore, biodiversity should act as a measure of biophysical integrity and biodiversity conservation might provide a viable framework for policies that drive economic activity towards overall biophysical sustainability. Economic instruments to implement a biodiversity constraint would penalise economic activities that directly or indirectly cause biodiversity loss and favour those that conserve it. A biodiversity constraint would, of course, require new legal and institutional underpinnings. What makes a biodiversity constraint doubly attractive is that it would also conserve the potentially large economic use and option values of biodiversity itself, thus removing the need for separate measures for its conservation.},

are essential for rapid and effective post disaster recovery and reconstruction process. A number of previous studies have
assessed vulnerability of infrastructure systems to various hazards such as earthquakes, but seldom have the impacts of post
disaster policies been considered. In its assessment of the water system in post disaster situation after Bam earthquake,
this paper examines the impacts of various reconstruction as well as water management policies on the system failure in operation
in terms of the ability of Bam urban water system to meet increased demand trends. Adopting a system dynamics modeling approach
and the concept of viability loops, the paper will show that in order to minimize further crisis in the water system during
the reconstruction period stricter water management policies need to be considered.},

abstract = {Recent case studies for individual locations and on individual urban challenges reveal the growing complexity of managing interrelations among population, infrastructure and institutions. Climate change is increasing the pressures on many urban systems and adding to this complexity. Many of the case studies investigating urban dynamics in the light of climate change have chosen narrow, sector-specific approaches. Few projects have built on insights from complexity theory and related bodies of knowledge which are more consistent with the perspective that urban infrastructure systems are tightly coupled with one another and must respond to often subtle, long-term changes of technological, social and environmental conditions. Drawing on that knowledge, and building on insights from previous case studies, this article explores the potential roles of complexity theory in guiding investment and policy decisions in the urban context. Policy and management that are consistent with insights from complexity theory will need to anticipate a wide array of potential trajectories for urban dynamics, identify and implement strategies that are robust under a range of potential developments, continuously innovate the policy-making and management institutions, and intensify the exchange of knowledge between science and \{society.Des\} \{\'{e}\}tudes de cas r\{\'{e}\}centes appliqu\{\'{e}\}es \{\`{a}\} des r\{\'{e}\}gions sp\{\'{e}\}cifiques et des d\{\'{e}\}fis urbains sp\{\'{e}\}cifiques r\{\'{e}\}v\{\`{e}\}lent une complexit\{\'{e}\} croissante dans la gestion des liens entre population, infrastructure et cadre institutionnel. Le changement climatique accro\{\^{\i}\}t la pression sur de nombreux syst\{\`{e}\}mes urbains, augmentant ainsi leur complexit\{\'{e}\} existante.

@article{Comfort2009,
abstract = {Abstract The challenge for policy makers and disaster managers is to achieve a balance between two dynamics --- resilience and entropy
--- in order to develop sustainable risk reduction. Achieving an appropriate balance between resilience and entropy in any given
community requires a systematic exploration of both dynamics. The recent hurricanes that struck Louisiana, Hurricane Katrina
on August 29, 2005 and Hurricane Gustav, on September 1, 2008, offer an unusual opportunity to assess the degree to which
both dynamics operated following Hurricane Katrina.},
