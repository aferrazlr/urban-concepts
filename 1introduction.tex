\section{Introduction}

Security is classicaly one of the intagible assets that sovereign states are
most keen to have. The Institute for Security and Open Methodologies defines
security as ``a form of protection where a separation is created between the
assets and the threat'' \cite{ISECOM2010}. However, security has been evolving
from the militar-centric notion to a wide scope of areas where a society can
suffer damage, e.g. economic security, energy security or environmental
security. Along with security concerns comes the interest in preventive concepts
such as resilience. From the urban planner perspective, resilience is ultimately
linked with the well being provided to dwellers in the face of a socio-economic
disruptive event (either with positive or negative consequences). In this work
we aimed at providing different measures of resilience both from a static
(input-output analysis) and a dynamic models (system dynamics).

Resilience in social-ecological systems has been studied in several approaches
from more ecological-centered (\cite{Holling1973}) to more 



Urban metabolism as a metaphore has been around for quiet a long time now \citep{Wolman1965}   
and the research around it has evolved towards some specific methodologies for urban areas analysis.
The majority of the analysis in the area of Urban Metabolism today is 
linked to \emph{Material Flow Analysis (or Accounting) (MFA)}  
essentialy as a tool compare regions performances in what regards to their demands, waste discharges or emissions. 
One of the many uses of MFA studies can be the production of input data for formal predictive models.

Another important concept that is usually linked to urban metabolism is the self sustainability appraisal.
Self sustainabilty is a broad concept which is largely translated (i.e. reduced) to self suficiency, 
and should be gather more eforts for a formal definition. For this work, \emph{resilience} is the key concept
to assess the (self) sustainabilty of urban areas.  

In this work I'll be focused on defining the conce

These models 
In this paper i'll propose some definitions, concepts and methodologies to 
 the citys' metabolism (analysis) should be put to its own rescue 



However not many authors have settled their opinions
