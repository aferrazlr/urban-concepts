For the kind of resilience measurements at aim in this work arises the need for
input output in very small regions (i.e. civil parishes \textit{(port. freguesia)} ) 

The construction of input output matrices for very small regions or even
individual entities is a disagregation exercise which has to be performed with
the proper caution since a lot of assumptions
