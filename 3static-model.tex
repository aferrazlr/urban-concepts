\subsection{High resolution Input Output coeficients}
For the kind of resilience measurements at aim in this work arises the need for
input output in very small regions (i.e. civil parishes \textit{(port. freguesia)} ) 


The construction of input output matrices for very small regions or even
individual entities is a disagregation exercise which has to be performed with
the proper caution since a lot of assumptions. 


Where survey-based information on regional sales and purchases is unavailable,
the regional modeller often has to use simple (e.g. employment-based) location
quotients (LQs) to derive estimates of regional input-output coeffcients from national
tables.


\emph{(justify the use of location coeficients)}
